The game menu narrator is sassy, the pretty boy protagonist is used as a work mule and straight man to the whims of the main character (Lloyd), and Lloyd is strong but never brute forces his way through a situation and instead uses his wit to achieve his goals. Speaking of wit the plans Lloyd ... comes up with are equal parts genius and hilarious making the story a consistent joy to read. The characters are likable and funny and the pacing is strong. The only issue I have is that the setting is generic but it's not too much of an issue in my book. Overall great comedy, I'd really recommend it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "This manhwa is without a doubt a masterpiece. When I first started this, I was genuinely expecting some other backwater hick isekai, but wow was I wrong. I've seen and read most isekai by this point, and just reading the title for this manhwa alone made me lose a couple of brain cells just thinking of how generic it sounds, but I can say with genuine clarity and sincerity, that this manhwa is master class. Also about the facial expressions, they are genuinely some of the whackiest I've ever seen. Seriously, the facial expressions alone are worth a 12/10, and the mc is quite possibly ... one of the most lovable scumbags I have ever seen. The only person I've seen more greedy than this man is either Mr. Krabs, or Scrooge McDuck, and that's saying a lot. It's never a dull moment following Lloyd in his quest to rob the world of every penny, and I've actually lost count the amount of times this manhwa actually made me laugh out loud. The supporting cast while although stale at first, also really grows on you over time, and one dimensional characters actually become quite memorable and really mesh in well with the story. While although the setting as well is a bit generic, the content and characters more than make up for it, and it honestly feels so damn unique compared to all Isekai out there, and it's really made a name for itself. If you're hesitating to read it, give it a try for a couple of chapters, but I promise you that it only goes up. Just when I think they've hit the ceiling, they keep breaking that barrier of sheer insanity time and time again."}, {"score": "10", "content": "An incredible ride. I have never laughed so hard in any manhwa / manga as I did in this one. Although at first glance it seems like another isekai cliché where the MC replaces the soul in someone else's body, it soon becomes clear that this is not the standard course. The story, although slow at first, gradually picks up speed with humor, but also drama and lots of action. I don't think I was bored by a single chapter or felt the need to skip it. On the contrary, I always looked forward to each chapter and had to read some more than once because they ... were just so entertaining. The main storyline was wonderfully concluded in Chapter 210 and it brought the MC's character development full circle. I especially have to appreciate that the author did not unnecessarily complicate the plot here, as some authors sometimes tend to do, and although new sub-plots constantly appeared, they always made sense and were clearly connected. I can only recommend it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Lloyd, who is the absolute definition of avaricious, leads this journey in the world of the \"The Greatest Estate Developer\", a masterpiece that every reader in the world should read. If you love hardcore fantasy, comedy where you fall onto the floor laughing and adventure that makes you regret your current life then this manhwa is perfect for you. When an isekai manhwa starts, most people expect the mc to be op while waiting for a harem to arise, but this manhwa is the complete opposite. I always had the biggest smile on my face after reading each chapter and have never felt so much ... sadness waiting for weekly updates. Story:- The engineer Kim Suho gets transferred into the novel he was reading, \"Knight of Blood and Iron\" where instead of starting off as the mc (Javier) he ends up in the body of the drunk Lloyd Frontera. Kim Suho, having worked his whole life, wanted to slack off but he has a lot of problems he needs to fix before acquiring his retirement. The story starts off kinda slow but it gradually gets more and more entertaining and thrilling to read. When I started to read this, it completely defied how an average isekai show starts. The story grows more complex after many foes appear and always leaves you itching for who will do what next. Characters:- Lloyd, the exact definition of materialistic, finds his way to the poor estate of the Frontera family. He doesn't hesitate to do anything to achieve his goals. He loves only one thing, money! There are many twists and turns that make him change, but he still aims for the same goal. Also his different faces might be a bit scary, but prepare yourself for the memes. Javier is a great sidekick who was supposed to be the mc. Ofc he is good looking and op, which makes for very funny situations when they are outside. The characters are unique and great. All the races show their own uniqueness. Both the good and bad guys are written greatly and some with very odd characteristics which makes them very laughable but lovable at the same time. Lloyd as the mc is the cherry on top of all this. Overall:- This manhwa is a definite must read for literally anyone who loves reading. It's really sad that such a masterpiece is talked about so little and has a small audience compared to big hits which pale in comparison to the story and development of this manhwa. You need to hop onto the Lloyd fan train before it heads to a crowded area. So I therefore recommend reading this and say that this will be the best decision in your lifetime.. \"If you think money can't buy happiness, you don't have enough money\" - Lloyd Frontera"}, {"score": "10", "content": "I'll get straight to the point (spoilers free) Listen, I'm all into petty mc and mc being the a-hole but this is just a next level.

But...there is a reason that The Greatest Estate Developer has become the highest rated manwha on MAL. The start of the story is like so many others in the isekai genre and the goofy nature of the \"system\" and his \"convenient plot devices\" make it seem like the rest of the story will turn out mid like so many others. I rate the start a 4/10. But then, something magical happens. The author and artist fully embraced each other's talents and realized what they were capable of. From then on, I had genuine bursts of laughter. That ... may not seem like much, but the most I ever react to a funny moment is with a smirk, but for this, I was clutching at my abdomen I was laughing so hard. The goofy nature of the manwha becomes part of the identity and hits you like truck-kun when you least expect it. I ABSOLUTELY hate telling people \"Oh but it gets better!\" but seriously, it gets SO MUCH BETTER.

There were moments when the students around me would stare, wondering why I was laughing like an idiot. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so much is that it deviates from the typical manga and anime formula. It doesn't follow the usual plot where the main character is overpowered and attractive, with the story often taking a backseat to focus on a predictable romance plot. This manga stands out for me because it avoids those cliches. The characters are well-developed, and the story feels like a dual protagonist narrative, which ... adds to its uniqueness."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I want to get through the review of \"The Greatest Estate Designer\" quickly. Why? Because I've been thinking for 2 days about how to describe why I found this story incredibly awesome. It's about a young man who has had to toil all his life. Although he had a good degree and was popular in the military, he was only ever taken advantage of because of his successes. But one day he wakes up with a hangover in the middle of the street to find that he is suddenly in the body of a nobleman who is the heir to a hugely indebted count - and ... that too in a story he only recently read. Can he now pull himself out of this mountain of debt with his education and knowledge in the field of construction, or must he fail because the nobleman has an incredibly bad reputation? Personally, I have a weakness for bastard protagonists who exploit others for their goals and mercilessly finish off their enemies. And that's exactly what I enjoyed so much here. Someone owes him for 520 years? No big deal, he's looking for a necromancer to revive him so he can work off the time. On top of that, we keep getting a glimpse of how tragic the story would actually be without him. While he is and always will be a bastard, that really only affects people who deserve it, while tragic heroes are saved by him. On top of that, he fights rather little and instead finishes off his opponents mentally or strategically. AND the most important: Here are the best expressions I've ever seen. Is that something special? No. It's just damn entertaining, I really had my fun and just can't complain."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Tl;dr: Idk why the comedy tag is missing. While not a full-on parody like Gintama, it is frequently closer to Gintama in tone than a serious story. If you don't take it too seriously you are more likely to enjoy the ride. Solid series overall, but has a few issues that leave me a bit surprised it has such a high average rating score. If you strongly dislike the comedy, story issues, and/or the subtle promotion of capitalism you can safely drop it as it shows no signs of changing those aspects. Otherwise, there is a decent chance you will enjoy the series. Let's start with ... the negatives: Story wise things basically always fall into Lloyd's lap perfectly. Either the \"system\" that put him there is purposefully influencing events as part of \"fulfilling his wish\" or it's just literally Deus Ex Machina to resolve conflicts that aren't based on Suho's knowledge of events in the novel he has been transported to or his engineering knowledge. Having a gatcha game provide him with the perfect tool to resolve his engineering dilemmas every time he uses it, getting new skills conveniently provided when needed, or surviving an encounter that he should have died from are some examples of this issue. There's still a chance for an explanation that at least explains the system related Deus Ex Machina, but not likely for all of it. There is also a tendency for Lloyd to have solutions ready for problems he knows little to nothing about as the story progresses further away from the original storyline he is changing. A recent example is when the Queen of his country, Alicia, is informed that the countries at the southern border are being difficult in trade negotiations due to a recent event. She is frustrated about the situation and cannot think of how to resolve it. She is also told immediately afterwards by the same messenger that Lloyd has returned from being gone for a while on a separate quest and seeks an audience. When she speaks with him, he immediately proposes a solution to the problem she was literally JUST informed about, despite being away from the capital for at least several days. It's just bad writing, and while this is probably the most egregious example, expect to see other examples of conveniently provided solutions to problems in the story that cannot be explained away by the system's influence. I should also mention that the set up for the premise is even worse than average for your typical isekai series, which is saying something with how low the bar is. I'm 142 chapters in and it's just some vague handwaving about a \"system\" that is probably magic but still remains almost completely unexplained. I'm not asking for much here either, an averageish isekai like Rising of the Shield Hero just had the people of the world summon him with magic there. That was sufficient enough for me to accept it initially with the expectation for further explanation later. The overused video game system trope is also present and there is no explanation for it yet either. I don't even think it is necessary to tell the story, so it just feels like a lazy writing shortcut. For comparison, the manga The Person in a Villainess has the person that gets isekai'd die and reincarnates as her favorite character in a fantasy Otome video game with the original soul also in the body and there are no video game system mechanics used in the manga. Whereas, Suho gets transported into a fantasy novel that has added video game mechanics to it. On a random note, the running gag about him having an ugly face compared to the beautiful face of the story's protagonist guarding him feels like a rip off of Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint (ORV)... It's used comedically, but there is no reasonable in universe explanation for it like in ORV. The problem is that he isn't actually ugly, it's only when he makes certain exaggerated faces that he actually looks ugly. So every time he gets called ugly without making a corresponding facial expression it just feels like beating a dead horse with the joke. The art itself is right around average for a Manwha. Maybe a little better. Despite all of these complaints don't misunderstand me that I think this a bad series or anything, just that I was expecting a bit more given its high average rating. Here are some of the positives: Despite my complaints about the overuse of the ugly face running gag, overall I found the comedy to be pretty good. Mostly slapstick humor with a few solid running gags that has the novel protagonist Javier play the straight man to Lloyd's craziness. While the story is fairly predictable overall in how things will resolve positively for Lloyd every time, it is still enjoyable to see how they manage to reach that destination. The pacing of the story is pretty good too, not too fast or too slow. The characters are also good. The female characters in particular have been much better than average. Plenty of strongly written female characters. Queen Alicia in particular stands out as both best girl and my favorite character overall despite her relatively limited screen time compared to our two protagonists. Speaking of which, both Lloyd and Javier are good characters too. They have great chemistry together as friends. Most of the other side characters are solidly written too. Although the villains themselves tend to be pretty basic. Since there is no major overarching villain the story mostly just cycles through different low level villains until they are either removed or conscripted into service for Lloyd. There is also some nice social commentary about society in Korea effectively mixed into the story too when it flashes back to Suho's previous life. It's rare enough and simple enough to not be preachy while also giving us some tidbits about Suho's background. Finally, the civil engineering aspect was interesting to read about. It is an engaging aspect for the story with how it teaches the reader while also showing Lloyd's ingenuity in adapting modern engineering techniques with medieval technology. Overall, I have enjoyed this series quite a lot thus far. We'll see if things change later but so far, it's just very good, nothing truly special yet. I'm willing to have my mind changed. Biggest swing factor is explaining why Lloyd got transported to this novel world and how that impacts the copious amounts of Deus Ex Machina. If done well the story could improve to a 9. Done poorly and it might drop to a 7. It started out as a 7 for me after the first 40 chapters or so but there have been enough improvements in certain areas that pushed it up enough for a soft 8 right now. Art - 6 Story - 7 Characters - 9 Enjoyment - 9 Thank you for reading."}, {"score": "10", "content": "If you want to read this and seeing my review then please go read.

Just the first 10 chapters you will be hooked up."}, {"score": "6", "content": "[More info about my review style can be found on my profile] ▶Summary and recommendation: ----------------------------------------------------------------- [The Greatest Estate Developer] is a comedic power fantasy with a nasty piece of shit for its protagonist. Like the title somewhat implies, it is an isekai with the premise of a civil engineer trying to develop his estate, but it all takes a backseat to the comedy. The comedy alone carried this manhwa for me, but it might not for you. While there is an overarching plot with stakes and some tension, it is not a very original isekai story and if you don't like the humour, I don't think the rest ... of the manhwa can save it for you. It takes a while for the humour to get going. and a good 20 chapters or so before the faces this manhwa is known for start appearing, so while I want to say \"give this manhwa 10 chapters to see if it is for you\", you might have to do a bit more than that to see if it is really for you. It is however very consistent with its humour and you will know if you like it very quickly once you do reach the funny parts. I recommend it, but you have to make sure it is your kind of humour. I would also warn any readers who do not like his personality and find it off putting, that it is not going to get any better any time soon. ▶Story: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The protagonist Suho kim, a construction worker from South Korea passes away and wakes up in the body of Lloyd Frontera, the son of a noble and a character from a novel he has read. Lloyd is neither liked nor destined for greatness, disliked by his family, and hated by his subjects, but with knowledge of the future and skills from the real world, he sets out to change all this. If you are tired of overpowered protagonists going on adventures and hoped the title and premise of this manhwa might mean he won't do that, you will be disappointed. While he continues to be a civil engineer, it does not stop him from leaving his estate behind to go on adventures. It is a power fantasy of a different variety, where the protagonist uses his deep knowledge of civil engineering to solve problems and gain allies in the fantasy world. As a power fantasy he rarely faces any challenges he can not overcome through various forms of plot armour and convenient luck. It is not a very deep story, and while there is an overarching plot, and some satisfying moments (It is always nice seeing a jerk punch an even bigger jerk) the story is not where the author put all the focus of this manhwa. That would be the humour. Humour is extremely subjective, even more than other aspects of a review, so it is hard for me to know if it will be enjoyable to other people. I personally kept laughing consistently throughout the 176 chapters that I read and I felt like the manhwa did an excellent job at staying funny throughout the entire manhwa. Lastly I would praise the pacing. It never felt slow to me, and there were always new elements introduced to keep the story (and more importantly; the humour) fresh. ▶Setting: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The protagonist is transported into a novel set in a Medieval low fantasy inspired setting. It is a fleshed out setting, with various countries, species, and culures, but there is not much originality Suho Kim is greeted with videogame like text on a pop up screen when he possesses the body of Lloyd, so there is some sort of god like being gameifying the world for the protagonist, and this plays a central part in the overarching plot of the manhwa. The author did (as far as I can tell) a lot of research for this manhwa. The protagonist shows knowledge of engineering and engineering history, and uses his knowledge well to solve various problems that might plague a medieval setting. The artist explains in a Q&A that he was instructed by the author to read several books on engineering to be able to portray the protagonist's engineering feats accurately, and as far as I can tell, they did well. ▶Characters: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The protagonist is a nasty piece of work. The original Lloyd is not a good person, but Suho Kim is no better. He is cocky and greedy to a fault, but unlike the original Lloyd he is also crafty, quick thinking and has the skills to put his nefarious plans into fruition. He is very unlikeable, and any character development that might happen, occurs so late in the story it is not worth mentioning in a review. But he is funny. He might be nasty, but to me that just made it so much more satisfying to see him be the butt of every joke, and misfortune. Javier is Lloyd's sidekick and the two make up the comedic duo that the manhwa is centred around. He is the serious one of the two but rarely the butt of the jokes. He has a fairly well developed personality and backstory and his kindheartedness makes the protagonist look even worse. The cast is surprisingly full of characters with (a tiny bit) more depth than I expected out of a comedy manhwa. I was surprised to see characters I did not expect to see again return much later, once more taking a prominent role in the story. Lastly the protagonist (or perhaps the author through the protagonist) has some very strong opinions on South Korean politics and society, and the author does not shy away from announcing those opinions. ▶Romance: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Romance? When the entire premise is built on the protagonist being ugly enough to make his own mother cry? It is not a romance manhwa, but perhaps there will be a happy ending for our anti-hero. ▶Artwork: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The art is a really mixed bag, where the character art goes between decent to amazing, while the background art is a consistent bad throughout the entire 176 chapters I read. Much of the humour of the manhwa is centred on the disgusting face of the protagonist and the extreme detail of his face does a good job at portraying this Sadly the background art comes up more than just a bit short. There is an extreme use of 3D assets, that mesh horribly with the rest of the scene, even when the majority of the scene is 3D assets. With the premise of the manhwa being architecture and large scale engineering projects and constructions, it is unfortunate that all the buildings and landscapes look so half-arsed. In addition to this, the action scenes involving Javier can be really hard to track, as there is a lot of just swinging of swords and energy beams with very little direction. ▶In conclusion: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is rare for a comedy manhwa to stay consistently funny for this long, and I am surprised and impressed by it still being funny after over 170 chapters. But if you are expecting a well written story and hoping the flawed characters will go through any satisfying character development, you will be left wanting. I really enjoyed this manhwa and I would really recommend it, but I have for the third and final time stress that if the comedy is not for you, then you will not find much to like. Without it; it is just a very standard fantasy adventure isekai but with a very unlikeable protagonist."}, {"score": "9", "content": "What else can I say about this series besides how amazing it is. Amazing comedy, excellent character dynamics, a well-substantiated power system that works in tandem with the basis of the story.

Having been released only three years ago as of this review, TGED has done a significant job in cementing itself as one of the best manhwa series to have come out of South Korea in recent years. If I had to summarize the series in one sentence, imagine a series that takes the worldbuilding and city ... development of Tensura, mixed with the comedic nature and timing of Grand Blue and Mashle, along with the similarity of Omniscient Reader (the MC knowing the story of the events that transpire). The author of the original WN has managed to write a story about property and development where the MC is an engineering student and a massive, selfish asshole who wants to live an easy life, and it just somehow works. TGED is a series that I would highly recommend if you're in need of a fresh take on the \"isekai genre\", even though it's Korean, or if you need a strong dose of comedy.

I didn't watch the rest of the edit as I don't want any spoilers. And lo and behold, only two days and I had already finished it. And yes, what a journey ... it was. At first, one might come to conclude that it is just your stereotypical piece of media; comedy that makes you frown, a story that has no story, a character that lacks any character, and an ending that doesn't feel like an ending. But if you are someone that doesn't judge a writing until you've read all of it, then you will be greatly rewarded. The story starts off with your typical reincarnation, where the protagonist gets transported to another world. But the thing is, it already starts off with the protagonist the moment he was transported. A mystery right from the get-go!

Often comedy manga, I find will have good jokes, but they are few and far between. It is rather special just how many jokes it manages to pack in it and how they don't get old.

Initially it starts off like most Isekai, the protagonist is overworked, and dies, blah blah blah, he finds himself in the body of one of the minor antagonist characters in the webnovel he was reading in his previous life. Wanting to avoid this character's fate, the progatonist (Llyod) decides to use his past skills as a civil engineer to uplift himself and his family out of all trouble. He's accompanied by the novel's protagonist, a sword master named Javier. The story has a lot of elements you see in other Isekai, Llyod ... has a system, his skills level up etc, he has some broken skills etc. What separates this from most isekai, however is the humor and the strong relationship between Llyod and Javier, the two protagonists. Javier starts out disliking Llyod but slowly starts coming around to him and his cooky ideas when he sees that Llyod's intervention genuinely improves the lives of the people in his estate. Watching Javier warm up to Llyod and his ways, even adapt some of them is a concept that is greatly executed. Another standout aspect is the humor. While the artwork is nothing special, the author uses the artwork for comedic effect, and it pays off. Sometimes when I read chapters, it makes my day when I see Llyod making the most evil face imaginable. It's really quite something to behold. Overall, this is a very light and fun read, and even if you don't like generic Isekai trash, there's really no reason to at least not give this a chance."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Ngl the start is like your typical isekai manga ( manhwa ) where the mc wakes up in the body of someone and tries to help himself with his know which in this manga ( manhwa ) is civil engineering But, the only reason i recommend it is bc after like 20 chapters it gets so good (my opinion) i don't like the plot twist or anything but i like the mc he made me laugh like 23 times while reading 159 chapters and am not lying he's the type who don't care about saving people and shi he wants me and he scams anyone he comes around ...

It starts off rather generic and unappealing, but then the comedy starts to kick in, the characters start to feel more interesting, the plot is more intriguing, back-stories are more emotionally convincing, art becomes more polished, and by the end, you're laughing your eyes out while struggling to contain the desire to continue reading until you collapse from exhaustion. Of course, there do exist some quite observable flaws, like the lack of logic involved in aspects of the world building (which is most apparent when trying to closely analyze how the societies of the fantastic creatures work the way they do, or ... why certain fantasy things aren't exploited), but these are rather unimportant elements for this type of story, which easily glosses over these factors with absurd amounts of comedy and plot development. To summarize, while the manwha has a one-dimensional background, the comedy, plot, characters, and overall enjoyment that this has more than makes up for all cons that come with it. As something I see as a near-perfect read for the comedy-action genre, I highly recommend this work."}, {"score": "10", "content": "A generic, comedy, slop isekai is what most people think of this and you could not be more wrong. The main thing that makes this manhwa so good is the fact the author can mix this story with multiple genres yet do it so perfectly, a talent that most can't. It can go from the funniest joke, to the most heart wrenching scene, a wholesome family bonding, or just pure romance. The protagonist Lloyd is so incredibly good for one reason, he's a real person that's it. Too many authors try to overcomplicate things but The Greatest Estate Developer doesn't do that, an average student got ... isekai'd so he tries his best as a regular mundane human with emotions. He complains, struggles, cries and feels fear like anybody would and that's what makes his character so damn amazing. He is such a refreshing protagonist simply due to him being an actual guy and not turning into a god, emotionless or a self insert. That is all while ignoring his many amazing moments, dialogues and character development. Second the characters, there's not too much to say here besides it's great. With such a wide and diverse cast of characters we get multiple unique personalities, cultures, actions, designs and it's done so perfectly. While not all of them are amazingly written there are many great characters and the cast fits perfectly into the story making it much more enjoyable. Next the plot, what's so good about this plot to me is that the story flows so well, it's not like random event or side quest after another, everything makes sense and goes well together. On top of that the arcs are actually very good and entertaining with comedy, action, emotion and enjoyment all fused together to make it perfect. In my opinion there's not a single boring or bad one. Finally the comedy, the entire manhwa is a comedy so you should expect to see a lot of it, on this topic I won't say much as comedy and humor is completely subjective so this is personal to everyone but to me I found it absolutely hilarious and was laughing at times like 5 AM. In conclusion I would heavily recommend this series, to me it's one of the greatest comedy piece of media I've seen but that's only one part of it, it has so many things that makes it perfect especially the conclusion which is absolutely beautiful and could get a grown man to cry."}, {"score": "9", "content": "At 127 chapter in I wouldn't say this is the greatest manhwa I've ever read or even read this year. But it's one of the most legit funniest things I've read since.... maybe Return of the Mount Hua Sect and even that isn't really funny so much as it has funny moments. The humor here is \"next level\" but not in the Gen X way most people mean. It's not taking humor to a place that's never been seen before. It's just doing humor different from any other story. It's not just a funny scene or a funny situation. The humor is based in the ... characters identity and relationships. It's fully embedded in the story. I would often find myself literally laughing multiple times per chapter when the humor was going thick. The story isn't *that* special and the MC *does* have OP/Convenient powers. He's a civil engineer and he's using modern blueprints in a medieval setting. That's the main draw. It's not a crazy new Isekai. The Isekai aspects are standard. Bog standard. He has a pop up window system. The popup window is snarky and responds to him (sometimes). But part of what really makes the series fun are the jokes that aren't just putting X in A but the embedded jokes that get tapped again and again. The MC is Lloyd the black sheep son of a family in debt. In the novel they're sourced from they die except for a single body guard Javier who goes on to be the main protagonist of the story. One of the recurring jokes is that Lloyd as a throwaway trashman character. His visage and countenance are ugly. He's a hideous man to look at. So when our Isekai hero jumps into his body he has to keep up that behaviour because people don't trust him when he's being sincere. And throughout the story they never stop seeing him as ugly unlike say the FMC in \"Not-Sew-Wicked Stepmom\". This leads to two types of jokes. The first is that people don't see Lloyd as nobility and they will sometimes assume he's the servant and Javier is the nobleman. It's great. Sometimes this is used to hilarious effect like when he has to speed date some rishtas. The B-side of this joke is that as he develops trust and friendship with Javier. They banter over how ugly Lloyd is which can be things from laughing when the former jokes happen to mocking him with Javier citing his TrueBeauty™ being unaffected by things like still being beautiful after a mudslide or taking 5g force and still looking good. The art likewise does the same thing give some Lloyd some great faces as he leans into his ugly visage. Turning it on to make deals while also unintentionally revealing his greed. As an Isekai story about developing land. I'd give this maybe a C+. It's not bad at it. There is some land development but contrary to some other reviews I don't understand what fun 200 chapters of land development would be for in the first place. There is distraction. There are other aspects. There's a little gay fanservice. I can feel the fans shipping Javier and Lloyd. So far there's not a lot of romance. There's some great fights and interesting ideas.

What makes it so compelling is that it doesn’t rely on the usual action-heavy tropes we see in many series. Instead, it focuses on creativity, intelligence, and problem-solving, all tied together with humor and strong character development. The main character is not the strongest fighter or a typical overpowered hero, but someone who uses his sharp mind, quick thinking, and knowledge to navigate an unfamiliar world. His ability to apply modern knowledge to solve problems in a medieval-like setting makes every chapter exciting. Watching him design solutions, ... negotiate deals, and build trust with others gives the story a satisfying sense of progress. The humor is another strong point. It’s woven naturally into the dialogue and situations, keeping the tone light and enjoyable even during serious moments. The supporting cast also plays a huge role in bringing the world to life, as each side character feels distinct, contributing to both the comedy and the plot. On top of this, the artwork is clean and expressive. The artist pays attention to detail, whether it’s in the architecture, landscapes, or character expressions, which adds another layer of immersion. The pacing is consistent—never dragging too much, yet giving enough time for developments to feel earned. Overall, Greatest Estate Developer is a highly enjoyable read.

Lloyd was a canon fodder character in a fantasy novel, a side character meant to be despised and die without anyone missing him. That is what was supposed to happen, but Suho doesn't want that shitty kind of ending now that he's gotten a second chance. He ... uses Lloyd's priviledge of being a rich boy and also his knowledge of engineering that he gained in his previous life.

It can definitely get annoying seeing this guy get sucked off at every turn, but there's a fine balance aspect. On one hand yes he is treated like the coolest, but he is also seen as an ugly, greedy, disgusting, uncouth freakazoid who is only tolerated or feared at first and has to prove himself to most if not all characters of importance. He only has one(?) love interest and not a full on harem like most isekai manhwa I've checked out then dropped because of too many Gary Stu pitfalls. In some arcs Lloyd can be pretty damn unlikeable, especially in the Hell arc I find, but overall he's a engaging character and you want to find out wheter or not he manages to steer his fate in the right direction.

No one is showing him any appreciation for his achievements. If I was him, I would've already stopped working for them. He has tons of money but can't do shit. Why? Because author doesn't want it.

It doesn't bother me much but these stories could learn a lot from the likes of Mushoku Tensei and still having ties to their past ... life. To emphasies more on what I said at the beginning; while this manhwa did feature oversaturated and generic things like a \"game menu\" it at least was unique with the other premise and theme of the story.. at least in the beginning. As time goes on, the manhwa protag quickly becomes overpowered and focuses more on fighting than what the title would suggest. He also quickly overtakes the \"fake protag\". (Not really sure what to call it. This Manhwa is about a guy that gets transported into the Manhwa he is reading but not as the protag of the story, but as a side character). He's meant to be an average guy while the \"fake protag\" is very strong. I didn't even get that far in before he's no longer an average guy but probably the strongest person in the story.

The author is great at portraying a character's life circumstances, you really get to understand their point of view and why they behave in a certain way. There is many characters that we discovered and each of them brought something new that could be a relatable life struggle to many teens around the world. It's so good I feel like the author has a background in psychology. Maybe this art is the authors way of telling people to be more compassionate. Whenever, I talk to older adults who might think manga and webtoons are kids/teens \"comics\" or that it's not \"mature\" enough, I strongly recommend this. Or if you know someone narrow minded you should strongly recommend it to them.

When you think you already understand it, they come out with deeper things about why they are the way they are, and on top of that, each time they have such character development despite their circumstances You can hate them or love them, sometimes you want to hit them but then you cry at the thought, because after all their emotions are so human that it makes you put yourself in their place and say that you would be just like them if you went through the same thing😭 The reactions of the characters to the events or situations were too realistic, it gives us different points of view due to the experience of each one and prevents you from trying to get the \"Correct\" point of view😭👏"}, {"score": "10", "content": "I'm speechless.

I haven't been so heavily attached to a comic in a long time.. The characters of this story seem to stay with you even after putting down the reading. The tone of the comic, as you read through it, is comedic and filled with realistic, unfiltered high-schooler dialogue, but the genre is undeniably categorized as \"drama\" for a reason. Without giving too much detail about the plot, I also wanted to talk about the unexpectedly satisfying art style. Simple lines with simple features, yet the artist is able to depict specific emotions better than most webtoon authors out there. The story is consistent, ... the characters act their age, and the situations make sense.

Their characters are written as the perfect textbook enemies to friends to potential something more (platonic or however else you see it), but the reality between the two is that because they're so similar in situation, they can never work! Two characters who truly understand each other, can see through the others actions, and can put their own life on the line for the other, also have the ability to tear each other down in the worst and most crucial ways. It's tragically realistic and as a reader, you want more than anything for a magical happy ending for. everyone. This story written by Wanan hits home for almost every family dynamic experienced, and it humanizes every situation from so many different perspectives. I was really surprised about the tone shift in the story when it's revealed that the reason Haejoon ran away from home is because of his mother's passing. I didn't expect Eunyung to be my favorite character in the entirety of media I've consumed in my whole life, and I didn't expect Juwan to be the glue connecting their weird little friend group all together.

Their personalities are polar opposite yet they compliment each other. They would be an undefeatble strong team and the weakest. The homeless tent guy was annoying in the beginning and this may be something that would put others off but ... it was done in the right way because his character development was just really amazing to see. The art is simplistic. Less is more. Almost comic like and this is done really well as it suits the story and style just fine.

Created by this talented artist-writer, the work stands as testimony to the strength of storytelling and its ability to touch on the most intimate aspects of the human experience. The story of No Home is one of heartbreak and deep emotion. It follows the journey its protagonist takes through a world full of uncertainty and struggle, battling with his identity and place in a world that can be both hospitable and cruel. Displacement, family, and personal growth ... are some of the themes explored in this manhwa, which evoke a deep emotional resonance, capturing the essence of what it is to seek a sense of belonging in a world that often seems fragmented. No Home shines by masterfully interweaving the most delicate lyrical storytelling with evocative artwork. Illustrations are not mere background here but an essential element in the development of the plot; every panel fills up in mood and emotion within the story. The colors, texture, and composition all combine to create an immersive experience-both visual and emotional-for the readers and the journey of the characters. The characters in No Home are well-developed and strikingly relatable. Their struggles, dreams, and vulnerabilities are depicted with such honesty that it's impossible not to feel a deep sense of empathy for them. The manhwa does not shy away from depicting the harsh realities of life but does so with a sensitivity and nuance that brings into light the resilience and hope that persists even in the face of adversity. More than just a story, No Home is ultimately an exploration of the human condition and one that reminds of the power of hope and perseverance. It dares readers to confront their own notions of home and belonging while offering the comforting reminder that even in the most desperate of times, there's always the possibility of finding one's way. In short, No Home is a modern manhwa masterpiece that should be celebrated for its emotional depth, artistic beauty, and the profound insights it offers into the human experience. It is a journey that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who reads it, making it a truly unforgettable work of art. Overall thoughts: A genuine read that will make one reflect on our lives. So realistic and portrays the family backgrounds of the common man. Final rating - 9"}, {"score": "10", "content": "For me after One PIece this is my favourite manga.

The story is a unique story where it shows how two complete enemies become best friends quite literally facing all kinds of hurdles and meeting all kinds of unique people.

Its storytelling is powerful, emotionally resonant, and far from superficial. The scriptwriting is of high caliber, with dialogue that feels realistic, heartfelt, and impactful. Every exchange between characters carries weight, often stirring strong emotions in the reader. The character development is particularly noteworthy, not only are the main characters richly developed, but even the side characters show meaningful growth and play significant roles in the story. My favorite character is the bald teacher. He stands out as a kind, wise, cool, ... grounded, and full of life experience. While the artwork is decent perhaps not outstanding, it effectively supports the tone of the narrative. The English translation is serviceable, though there's room for slight improvement in phrasing. At its core, No Home is a sad, painful, and heartbreaking story. It's a tearjerker that hits close to home for many readers, tackling themes that are too realistic. In conclusion, what I love most about this manhwa are its story, dialogue, and characters. It absolutely deserves the high rating it has received from readers. Fantastic storytelling.

However, I think a 10/10 series is a series that perfectly conveys what it is aiming to and capitalizes on its strengths to do so. The Horizon is a series that I think does just that: its messages and themes are clear all throughout and it is a master of showing and telling with its narrative. It is an existentialist story in every sense of the ... word: it confronts some of the most painful truths of human existence: we have been made to suffer, in many cases inflict suffering on each other, and we all have to face the deaths of friends, loved ones, and ultimately ourselves. The series looks at the ways that we try to overcome this suffering, the meaning that we find in ourselves, others, and the events of the world around us. Every aspect of the series serves to highlight these ideas and prompt the reader to ask themselves how they will confront these harsh truths. Story: 9/10 The premise of the story is simple enough: There seems to be some kind of massive war going on that has decimate the country (specific location isn't given), two kids (named \"the boy\" and \"the girl\") run into each other in the chaos, work together to survive, and become friends. They run into other people along the way and face many challenges. Special attention is paid to specific challenges and characters that the boy and the girl face and they gradually form their own perspective on the world. There is a lot of suffering in this story as we are shown the impact of war on innocent lives (highlighted even more by the fact that we have no clue what caused the war or what parties are involved), disease, and insanity. Art: 10/10 The art for this series is amazing mainly because the author was incredibly intentional about how he used it. The author often likes to show his ideas rather than say them. As an example, there is this moment where the boy's thoughts are represented as images that are gradually get more abstract to show that his thinking is spiraling. There are also moments where there are no backgrounds for multiple pages so the reader can digest things that have happened and soak in the expressions on the characters face. But sometimes this minimalism is contrasted with the most gorgeous scenes that you would immediately want to make a background for a phone or computer. There is hope in the midst of the hopeless of this story and that is reflected in the art. Characters: 8/10 The boy and the girl are interesting characters in that we mainly see them reacting to their circumstances than having conversation (although there is an ample amount of inner dialogue and interactions). Their reactions to what's happening to them are realistic and they differ from each other in their responses: The boy seems to have a \"delayed\" response to trauma where things don't hit him in the moment but he has a kind of dissociation experience until it hits him later. The girl seems to experience everything immediately and breaks down in the moment. Both of these responses make perfect sense and the author does a good job of conveying them. The other characters that they have experiences with (namely the strange man and the man in the suit) don't get developed as much but I think they are simply supposed to represent different ways of responding to the cruelty of the world. The man in the suit draws on tropes that we have seen before (a person seeking out a gray sense of justice because of injustice done to them) but it is done tastefully and the interesting thing here is how the boy interacts with him. There could have been more time devoted to developing the new characters after the timeskip, but the integrity of the story wasn't compromised because of the lack of development. Enjoyment: 10/10 I was engaged throughout the whole series and felt genuine empathy towards the characters. I enjoy stories that explore these kinds of themes and there were many moments that I was blown away by the execution. Overall: 10/10 The series did a wonderful job exploring its existential themes and using the art, characters, and narrative to that end. It is story that most people who like psychological tragedies will at least enjoy. Although I rate it as a 10/10, I can see how people would see the issues I raised as evidence that it shouldn't have the rating.

Most people would probably say no considering they have a rational mindset. Mainly because I haven't answered the deeper questions, something along the lines of \"why do we exist?\" or \"what is the point in anything if it all ends?\". To which I say, \"lmao, chill, just vibe doe.\" In any case, I am no philosophical genius, so I can't really answer that for you, but in the same case, I am not wrong with my answer. Neither am I right. It is a strange thing to think about, in which we only do it simply because we are intelligent and have the ability to reason. Should we consistently look for the answer to these, I suppose, \"pointless\" questions? When should we even start asking those questions? Look. I have given more questions here than answers. Or have I? The Horizon aims to answer the question of life we all have lingering in our minds somewhere. Does it do a good job at that? Well. To some extent, it does for sure, but there are a few problems this has that doesn't look like is being said about, so I would like to insight some of those thoughts I have. Narrative: Ultimately, The Horizon is a message. I say this because there is no care about writing a story. Well, it does. It just does so with little to no effort. I find myself questioning the world at hand a lot to the point where I can safely say such a world would be absurd. Not because of the catastrophic state the world is in here, but because of what happens in this catastrophic world. I question where some of these character backgrounds are from, I question why plot conveniences exist here, I question what the hell is up with these character actions. You see, if you are writing to send a message to the audience, there is ultimately no need to care about storytelling, because you should be only sending the message. Obviously, you need some characters, not always, but most use characters, developed though? Who cares? They exist only to send out a message. Look at Puparia as an example. Why do you think abstract art makes no sense? It's a form of art with some underlying message, maybe even none at all. Hell, look at Shiroi Kumo, a manga that would relate more to this. But The Horizon incited a real developed beginning-to-end story, thus being subject to everything a story needs to make it work. So the storytelling here is so silly that it is almost ridiculous. However, I will tell you that despite what seems to be unrealistic. The message has been sent, and it was a very good one at that. Even though everything was attached haphazardly, the main points and messages that were supposed to get across to the viewer were sent in good fashion. This is a really dark pessimistic work that looks at the value of life in the lowest of times. I would say to some extent that this may even be a 10/10 in that category. Despite calling out on how dumb the story is at times, I would be a liar to say that I didn't get what The Horizon was influencing, it was seriously dark stuff. But if only it held itself together and I would have enjoyed this more. If I am going to talk about real stories, I should focus on the characters. They are both unnamed. Whether that was in the name of hidden meanings or laziness is something I will never know. The boy and the girl are pretty good characters, despite being slapped together to do things in whatever the story called for, they were really good, their development was real for the most part and I have to praise it for that. Some inconsistencies in their action that make them seem dumber than they should, it makes them worse characters, but nothing vile. Other side characters, not so much better or worse. Not that they were focused on a lot, which would make sense in the route that should have been taken. There was one arc with really good side characters though, it focused more on the girl's life and gave some insight to people we will never see again. They were really good in my opinion despite not having a lot of the spotlight, like 2 or 3 of them were. Not the rest. Nothing really bad in terms of characters overall. So I thought the characters here were pretty well made to some extent. Art: The art is amazing, that is without question, and you will see how the use of colour plays into bettering the scenes' moods and atmospheres. The character design and extraterrestrial unearthly beings were drawn with such a high precision of accuracy and focus. Little fault with the detail here. However, I'd say 9.5 due to lack of attention to backgrounds, whether the world is supposed to be empty or not, well, I am not sure. It would have been nice to see a little more though if I understand where I am coming from. Enjoyment: Well, the story was dumb, but it is cool to see and think about what Jeong Ji-Hoon thinks about human life, or maybe it wasn't them and someone else's philosophies they took. I wouldn't know again. I suppose this just serves as something to look at and reflect from as an enjoyment factor. I didn't do too much of that but The Horizon does get you thinking at times. There is nothing else The Horizon wants to give other than that, so the message side of things is everything that is of the story. Which is a shame but it is what it is. Overall - 6.73 (7, lowered art score significance, it would have been 7.13 but for the sake of consistency and the main point, I lowered anyway) ---------- TLDR Review: Story - 4: Silly story, which is a shame because it didn't need to care that much but it did. Doesn't care too much about what goes on in the world really. Art - 9.5: Amazing. Colours, detail, design. All great. Characters - 7: Good characters, have a progression that makes sense but hindered by inconsistent actions. Enjoyment - 8: Message was sent, and it is where you can enjoy what the story is trying to say. A really good dark pessimistic outlook on life that gets you thinking. Overall - 6.73 (7) ---------- I tried to read this for quite a while now and just didn't get to reading it because small screen rip. I have to say, whilst leaving this, well, I got what I imagined this to be. A dark story. I didn't think the actual story would not work out, but I legit don't even care anymore lmao. I would recommend this, would also recommend you binge this as the connection to each arc is some random cut off. You probably won't look into the story as much as I did but hey, I said what I had to. For an \"edgy\" story, this was good I suppose, though we get a lot of that don't we? The appeal in this? Idk lol, maybe because it looked good. No clue."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I just finished this and i don't even have words to describe what i read. Beautiful, simply beautiful. The writing is simplistic but realistic. But the art, dude. The art really takes it to another level. Both the colored, black and white and chaotic sketch pannels all immerse you into the story. This is what war is. The characters are believable and very human, every single one of the characters acts their own way and aren't just some twisted reflection on what the author feels. To finish my review off: This is a must read if you believe war is a good cause... Because it'll hit your ... dumbass with the realization of what it truly brings to the world. 10/10, must read, had me tearing up in class."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Firstly, the Story: 10 -- Horizon is a manhwa of two main characters that are traveling aimlessly during a time of war, entailing a series of incidents that questions their moral compass and scenarios where death seems inevitable. However, in the midst of chaos and destruction, the characters are able to rely on one another to take another step in their life. It warmed my heart seeing two individuals, despite the circumstances, being able to find joy and happiness in one another and strongly moving forward together. Secondly, the Artwork: 10 -- The artwork is very unique and different from the usual manhwa and mangas you would read. The author ... does an incredible job illustrating the emotion that is being expressed or currently felt by the characters, and it's amazing how well he communicates with the readers with the artwork rather than solely through words. Lastly, the Overall: 10 -- I highly recommend you to read this manhwa if you are looking for a piece that would leave a \"rock in your shoe\" to make you question your perspective on life. This piece flooded my thoughts and forced me to sit down and reevaluate, think, and how I perceived life and exactly what kind of purpose I am following. A serious recommendation from me :) (This portion below isn't a review but rather a commentary of what the message the author was REALLY trying to portray, so ONLY READ IT IF YOU\"VE READ IT ALL) -- I believe most, if not all of the reviews, have completely missed the intended message of \"Horizon\". I myself did not recognize till the author deliberately used the Bible to further portray a message far more devastating and hopeful than it really meant. Firstly, the author quotes the infamous verse of King Solomon's book of Ecclesiastes (bible), \"Vanity, vanity, all is vanity\" to which King Solomon portrays the meaningless of life since we all die and all the efforts go to waste. What King Solomon wanted to portray in the book of Ecclesiastes is the meaningless of life when you toil after materialistic things, but on the other hand, if you toil after the glorification of the One Triune God, it is all counted as worthy. The author does an INCREDIBLE job in building up the theme of what King Solomon wanted to portray in Ecclesiastes using the story and the reason the sniper lived for, the band of thieves performing immoral actions to satisfy their needs/get their revenge, the girl's memory of the bus and the sickness, and lastly even the death of the girl. While all seemed meaningless and hopeless, the author ends the message of \"horizon\" with the boy finding hope in Jesus Christ and placing his trust by grabbing his nail-pierced hand. In conclusion, the message is this, the world is cruel, evil, and disgusting because of sin, and living a life with a hope placed on materialistic things that will come to pass will only bring delayed suffering. However, we can find true hope in believing in the eternal King, Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sake of mankind. p.s please have grace on my review as it is my very first! I want to thank you for reading it up to this point and hope that you understood what I was trying to say. If you have any question regarding with Christianity or desiring to understand the depth of the message (understanding it in depth is why I loved this masterpiece so much) please reach out to my ig @timewithJesus"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Wow, it can be hard for me to find something i can truly rate a masterpiece but this is amazing.

There's a lot of emotions showed in this manhwa and those things are the ones that make me love this show.

The main character and the heroine are really cute, while walking on the road, they talked about a lot of things and they met some interesting and lovable characters. They showed many kinds of human emotions and way of thinking that makes it sad to read. Enjoyment-10/Overall-10 I really enjoy this Manhwa, i have this in one of my favourite manga and you should read this one, this manhwa isn't like other kind of manhwa or webtoon where the story isn't really that good.

The panelling is the best I've seen, conveying the characters' emotions so vividly that we feel what they’re feeling. We understand their fear of being alone in this world, their desire to survive. The artist masterfully uses negative space and silence in the panels to amplify the characters' isolation, allowing the reader to feel their quiet desperation in a way that words alone could never express. When the bombs hit, it feels like they’re hitting me instead. But in the end, we’re reminded that no matter how dire the circumstances or how deep we’ve sunk into despair, we ... must move forward. The boy had so many excuses to give up, but he didn’t. Eventually, his hellish life had some meaning behind it, and that’s what we have to learn.

The reason is simple, I achieved a certain attachment to the characters, with most of those presented I managed to feel sadness and anguish for what they were experiencing, but things happened so quickly that although I ... felt genuinely sad, it was not such a deep like the one I would have liked to feel (but yes, there were moments that would have easily made me cry).

The overbearing bleak atmosphere dominates this work, while simultaneously making those few moments of happiness so much sweeter. The author pulls absolutely no punches when portraying topics. More so than what I have previously mentioned, the thing that stuck with me the most was how much meaning and emotion is portrayed not through dialogue, but simply through imagery. In fact, there is very little dialogue at all. The art and pacing has absolutely no filler. Not a single panel is wasted. Everything in this story is there for a reason. ... I cannot name another manga that has made me feel as many emotions to the extent that The Horizon has. The straightforward (literally) concept allows for a story that in it's grit and ugliness is absolutely beautiful. It is an absolute crime that this is not better known. I do not often use this word, but it is an absolute masterpiece. I cannot praise this work enough."}, {"score": "10", "content": "It's a mostly contemplative, harsh and bleak story, sort of in the vein of Blame! which means little dialogue and loneliness abound. It will make you react emotionally whether you like it or not, it's abrupt and brutal in it's approach for sure in regards to the relationships within The Horizon. By no means it conveys schadenfreude, you will root for the characters like you're there. I recommend witnessing for yourself this tragic story has humans are portrayed like merciless survivors, hopelessly clinging to life when all hope is gone. It has a beautiful depth to it and is, in my opinion, deserving of the highest ... rating. It may be a short manhwa and to the point, it may even be simplistic in it's art style, but surely has a magic of it's own. One of the things I particularly enjoy when reading manga (contrary to anime) is that I can read while listening to a suitable soundtrack of my choosing, that definitely heightens the mood. I would go for something more dark ambient, or even something heavier and doom-ish. And yes.. it will make you want more development, context and explanation by the end. That's never a bad thing, it means it lingers in your mind, like all the stuff you experience intensely and makes an impression on you, and that itself can be considered \"good art\". The Horizon, is one of those works of art, and I fully recommend it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I feel compelled to write a review on this, never once has a story really gripped the essence of my being so much as this one. It's depressing. The harsh dynamic between the pure beauty of life and love, and its equally beautiful fragility. One day we are all going to die, it's inevitable, and being afraid is okay. Having worries is okay. Having fears is okay. It's part of what makes life as beautiful as it is. Stories like these genuinely make me happy; which I'm aware contradicts the very first line of my review. You're not alone in this vast and wide world and ... as depressing and lonely existence can feel sometimes you've had a part in this wide, wide history no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. To take away from this story i'd only like to preach one thing, and not to be a crazy religious enticer, is to be kind. Being nice and loving can only help people, even if it's just one line in the crazy story book that every person's life is, it's one line that wouldn't have been there without you.

The use of gore and even showcasing scenes that were very disturbing to see at the beginning was quite brilliant and its the strong point of this ... manhwa Overall- 10/10 Characters So basically we follow our two leads the boy and the girl, there names were never revealed. Occasionally, some other characters were too introduced like the man in the suit, the leader of a bandit group, the strange man. We also got a dive into the past of the girl which really made the latter part of the story more impactful Overall- 7/10 Story The story is not that basic but has elements which you would see in Korean dystopian movies. The pacing is very well done 'I liked It'. The author threw obvious death flags in between the chapter. It was going quite well for me at the beginning, the two leads had basically no where to go the world were cruel enough for two literal kids. Having not enough food or water from days we can see their conditions worsening. The factor which ticked me a little was the cannibalism and the fact that the author was deliberate in making it a tear jerker not contradicting that it a story of living on and reflecting on oneself Overall- 7/10 I have to say this that its not a waste of time has holds a valuable meaning and message of loving one self and forgiveness I am not so good when it comes to reviewing but I think the things I wanted to say were clear if you're thinking of reading this than you will not feel like you've wasted time and I recommend reading the other works of the author of The Horizon too"}, {"score": "8", "content": "The Horizon is a manhwa with a story that is tragic, cruel, and deeply depressing. Yet, I find solace in how the final chapters adopt a calmer, more melancholic tone. The opening chapters are brutal and unflinching. They serve as a powerful introduction, making it clear that although the protagonists are children, this is not a story meant for children nor is it a world they should ever have to witness, let alone endure. One arc that stands out to me is the one involving the old, seemingly mad man who begins to follow the two children. It’s a masterfully crafted segment that plays with the reader's ... expectations leaving us uncertain whether he is a potential companion or a lurking threat. What ultimately happens to him is both shocking and satisfying. Above all, the greatest strength of this manhwa lies in its art. The illustrations are exceptional, hauntingly beautiful. They capture the bleak, tragic atmosphere of the world so vividly that words often become unnecessary. In fact, even when dialogue is sparse, each panel tells its own story clearly and emotionally. The art doesn’t just complement the narrative, it elevates it. However, I do have a share of criticisms. Firstly, the narration. I believe the story would have been stronger without it. Much of the narration simply describes what is already evident from the visuals, lines like \"The boy and the girl met,\" or \"They stared at each other.\" These do little more than state the obvious. The art speaks for itself, and I feel the impact would have been greater had the story relied more on dialogue and silence, rather than narration that adds little depth. Secondly, the story lacks context. We are shown the aftermath of a war, but we are never told why it began, how far it spread, or why no larger forces such as governments or international organizations intervened. The absence of this background leaves a void in the world building, making the setting feel more like a backdrop than a fully realized reality. I understand that mystery can be powerful, but in this case, a bit more information could have strengthened the weight of the narrative. Thirdly, the recurring motif of “a boy and a girl pair holding hands” becomes repetitive and clichéd. It begs the question: why always a pair like this? Why not two friends, a band of survivors, or even strangers forced to rely on each other? Exploring different types of relationships could have added more depth and variety to the emotional landscape. Lastly, the character development is perhaps the weakest aspect of the story. The boy and the girl's name are not even revealed. This anonymity, while possibly intentional, makes it harder to form a lasting connection with them. Their story may linger in the mind, but the characters themselves risk fading into abstraction. They never even introduce themselves to one another, and that absence of identity limits the potential for meaningful growth or evolution. And yet, despite these shortcomings, The Horizon still left a mark on me. Its greatest virtue is its boldness, it does not flinch from darkness or sorrow. It shows the world as broken and merciless, but it does so with honesty."}, {"score": "9", "content": "The Horizon definitivamente é uma obra muito especial, ela traz questionamentos interessantes, nos faz pensar realmente para aonde nossa vida vai, mesmo com planos estabelecidos, eles podem sumir como poeira.

Despite being only 21 chapters long \"The horizon\" shows us many different ways in which war influences people, but all of them have one thing in common, it changes innocent civilians into withered versions of themselves. This story is universal, it can take place in every single country on the planet and the suffering, death of the innocent and emotional trauma will follow it whereve it goes Every character has their own way of percieving the world around them and has been influenced by it in many different ways, some are willing to do anything in order to survive, others have been completely destroyed and their life has changed into one long streak of pain and suffering. In this world no one is safe, main character is oftenly walking along hundreds of nameless corpses which belong to regular people who just haven't been lucky. This manhwa tackles topics of existentialism, schopenhauerism, nihilism but most importantly pacifism, right from the get go we see innocent civilians being murdered and later on we get to see that even those who managed to survive will to have to do many morally questionable things in order to survive. This series won't give you an easy answer, each ideology and approach to the situation that characters are in is presented with both flaws and merits but none is presented as the definitive, correct one. The visuals are simply stunning, every single pannel conveys a message, some are genuinely terryfing, others really sad but all of them tell a story and this manhwa simply wouldn't be as good without them. Pannels can be both expressionistic, naturalistic and symbolistic, and even a combination of all of those styles, it really depends on the context but one things certain, all of them hit hard. Ji-Hoon Jeong is especially good at portraying facial expressions, just all it takes is a glance to understand what a given character is feeling and the more you look at it the more you get it, it almost seems as if the author has seen Dante's hell. In conclusion, \"The horizon\" is not the most pleasant manga to read, it tackles many serious topics and presents many deprresing scenes, but despite that it's a masterpiece. The author did his best to show a universal depiction of war, one that can happen everywhere and ruin many lives. Thanks to the impeccable visuals the series emotional climaxes are way more memorable.

As I said The horizon is not a mahwa for entertaiment it shows a horrible situation which a lot of people unfortunatly have to go through but it also show us how important is human life and that you can go through even the most awful situation but the greatest part is that it shows what humans really are they are complicated cratures who can create the worst destruction but also they can create the most beautiful miracles.10/10"}, {"score": "9", "content": "The review in a nutshell is great story with good experimental art that evokes emotion from the reader. Please read it. Story: The story of the horizon centers around a boy in a world not unlike ours except a mass scale war destroying all semblance of order and honor. Humans roam a dead world and are conditioned to view each other as problems or resources. The reason for the mass destruction is never given, but that is not necessary. Korea, in our world, has gone through a horrific war of foreign influence, of people from beyond the horizon using their lands as a battlefield. The ... threat of war is also present in their minds, so the reason the powder keg ignites is less important than the fact that it ignites. The desolation is broken by sounds of gunfire, of missiles fired from miles away, of screams and then silence. Humans are simultaneously a relief and a worry. The boy meets a girl, and they walk on a road. They walk forward. Art: The art is extremely well done. I'm not a usual reader of Korean comics, but this is a FAR step ahead of what I have usually seen from there. It goes beyond American and most Japanese comics I've seen as well. It evokes emotion through exaggeration of human facial expressions. Contemplative dread is seen in the eyes, the pain of the heart contorts their faces, the great big smiles of happiness. Serenity of Love. It also becomes more abstract, thoughts of death and loneliness become scribbles in the brain or a deep abyss. As someone who struggles with depression at times, this is a good showcase of what it feels like. Characters: It's a short manhua so do not expect a lot of development from the side characters. This does not mean they are bad characters. Some people seem to think if you're character doesn't have some kind of great journey of retrospection that you see, they are bad and flat. These characters are not bad in my opinion. They serve their purposes and do it very well. All these people used to be like you and me. Living a daily grind and finding satisfaction if something or other. We meet them thrust in this world, and we can see what it has made them. Their character is what they've become and if you could see yourself becoming that. Personally, it strikes me. You just see desperation now, it is anxiety inducing. You want life to go back to how it was, so they never have to do these things to survive again. Final thoughts: This is a depressing story. Frankly I avoided it for this reason. I can not handle these stories like I used to. But I had heard it was bittersweet, not all is bad. I hope you do not see it as a spoiler since I will not say what EXACTLY happens, but it is true, there is hope in here. I'm a Christian, I struggle with it sometimes but I love going to church, and this story handles suffering in a similar way. Suffering is not to be ignored. It can not be. It will EAT you if you do. You will suffer. It will hurt. It will break you down. And you can build yourself up. Is there suffering that will end you? Of course, no one lives forever. Is there suffering that will temper you? Of course, you can not realistically have lived long enough to read this if hardships could knock you down forever. All we can do is live in those between moments, to be strengthened by our suffering and say tomorrow brings tomorrow. You do not have to be Christian to believe this, of course. I have finished Mob Psycho before this and I think there is a similar message there.

Many characters wish to die to end the suffering plaguing them and will give up living if it means to end the insufferable loneliness and pain. We learn however that when we find someone we care about, we find new meaning in protecting them. We see characters relearn humanity through each other. Demonstrating the artists belief that human connection can conquer fear and pain. When we find others who bring forth joy we discover that life is not meaningless, and death can not erase the connections we have made. I have never experienced a apocalyptic story that focused so little on the actual events of the disaster, instead showing how the characters interact within it. This leads to a compelling tale of the human psyche. Displaying the ideas of nihilists and how they interpret the world around them. Love is what makes the world grounded and round, it leads us down a never ending path. This path even with no clear direction is enjoyable since it can be walked with others who feel the same things we do. This is the beauty of the world and the reason we strive to live. \"The Horizon\" is a masterpiece that showed me the importance of relationships. I hope it will do the same for you."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I have never written a review before but this deserves it.

Stories like Mobile Suit Gundam emphasize the devastating impact of conflict by forcing children into the horrors of war, leaving them emotionally scarred. Similarly, Grave of the Fireflies offers a heart-wrenching perspective on the aftermath of war, highlighting the suffering endured by ordinary people caught in its wake. It’s no surprise that war narratives often lean into horror, revealing the grotesque and inhuman facets of conflict. Two prominent examples of this approach are Come and See, a Belarusian film that portrays war in its most ... repulsive, harrowing form, and Barefoot Gen, a manga that delves into Japan’s wartime history. The latter explores Japan's surrender following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and depicts Gen’s personal struggles to reconcile with the unimaginable devastation of war. Adding to this tradition is The Horizon, a manhwa that has recently garnered significant attention on social media. Manhwa as a medium has been on the rise, with titles like Solo Leveling achieving mainstream recognition worldwide. The Horizon has benefitted from this surge in popularity, receiving rave reviews and earning a place as one of the highest-rated manhwas online. But does it truly live up to the hype? The answer to that question is, well... complicated. THE BEGINNING Right out of the gate, The Horizon wastes no time in laying bare the horrors of war. An unnamed boy is thrust into a chaotic world, witnessing the panic and terror around him as it is swiftly replaced by an eerie, haunting silence punctuated by the sight of lifeless bodies strewn across the ground. During this carnage, he desperately searches for his mother, only to find her lifeless form—a grotesque and horrifying sight, her head reduced to a gory mush. The moment is a blur of trauma, too sudden and overwhelming for the boy to fully process. Consumed by a whirlwind of nihilistic thoughts, he begins to move forward aimlessly, his mind in a haze, until he finds temporary shelter in an abandoned bus. After a brief rest, the boy encounters a girl. They exchange silent stares, heavy with unspoken questions and emotions neither can articulate. But their fragile moment of calm is short-lived as the thunderous sounds of bullets and explosions once again shatter their fragile world. Together, they flee, running through the chaos and madness, their young minds grappling with the incomprehensible reality of their situation. The boy hesitates at first, but the sight of the crying girl sparks a flicker of determination within him. He regains his composure, guiding her toward the sanctuary of a forest. In the quiet embrace of nature, the boy finally experiences a brief reprieve from the relentless anxieties of war. The serene beauty of their surroundings offers a stark contrast to the destruction they fled, and for a fleeting moment, the world feels almost normal. Then, they come upon a road—a road that stretches endlessly into the horizon. The girl, breaking the silence, asks where they are going. The boy, burdened by his nihilistic thoughts, responds that they can go anywhere, but laments that their journey, like everything else, might eventually come to an end. The girl, however, offers a different perspective. She reassures him that the Earth is round and that no matter where they go, they will always be held in place. Her words carry a simple yet profound hopefulness—that as long as they keep moving forward, the road will always remain before them. For the boy, this optimism is alien and almost incomprehensible, but he chooses to put aside his despair, if only for a moment, and walks alongside her. Just by the very first chapter alone, we witness The Horizon’s most poignant themes in full display: the contrast between despair and hope, destruction and resilience. For the boy, the girl's words represent a lifeline—a reminder that even in a world consumed by chaos, the human spirit can cling to meaning and connection. As they walk together into the unknown, readers are left to ponder their own perspectives on life’s uncertainties. Would we succumb to the despair of an endless road, or, like the girl, find solace in the idea that the journey itself has value, even without a definitive destination? The Horizon challenges us to confront these questions, making its bleak yet hopeful narrative resonate on a deeply personal level. ARC #1: THE MAN The Horizon begins its first arc with the young duo encountering a mysterious figure referred to as “the strange man.” From the outset, the man’s demeanor is unsettling. He greets the children with an almost unnerving enthusiasm, but the reaction from the duo is telling—while the boy is immediately suspicious and fearful, the girl displays cautious friendliness, her innate empathy shining through despite the circumstances. This fragile dynamic doesn’t take long to unravel. The boy’s distrust is validated early on when the man suddenly lunges to drink the boy’s water without warning, consuming it before the child can react. It’s a jarring moment that underscores the desperation of their world, where survival often overrides decorum or morality. Though the girl consoles the boy by offering her own water, he quickly warns her against doing so in the man’s presence, reinforcing the danger posed by this stranger. Their unease escalates as the duo attempts to escape the man, but their efforts are thwarted when a nearby explosion alerts him to their location, allowing him to catch up. From this point, the story shifts into a tense battle of wits. The boy, grappling with his growing fear and frustration, tries to maintain a delicate balance: rationing food and water between himself and the girl while also managing the unpredictable threat of the man. Despite his young age, the boy demonstrates remarkable resourcefulness, resorting to subtle psychological tactics to wear the man down. A particularly intriguing moment occurs when the man reacts with visible fear to fire, hinting at a deeper backstory or trauma. However, this thread is left frustratingly underdeveloped, serving more as a passing detail than a meaningful element of the narrative. As the arc progresses, the tension between survival and morality intensifies. The girl’s empathy for the man clashes with the boy’s pragmatic wariness. While the man is portrayed as erratic—eating raw animals and displaying almost animalistic behavior—he also shows genuine care for the girl, complicating the boy’s perception of him as merely a threat. This dynamic creates an interesting moral conflict, as the boy reluctantly tolerates the man at the girl’s insistence. However, this precarious truce crumbles when the man’s darker nature surfaces. In a pivotal and deeply unsettling moment, he attempts to assault the girl, an act that seals his fate. He is subsequently killed, bringing the arc to a grim and violent conclusion. When compared to the arc’s strong opening, the resolution feels disappointingly hollow. The initial ambivalence surrounding the strange man—his humanity versus his menace—had the potential for a much richer narrative payoff. Jeong makes repeated attempts to hint at the man’s humanity, such as his fear of fire and his care for the girl, but these elements are ultimately discarded. Instead, the strange man devolves into a one-dimensional antagonist, reducing the moral complexity to a straightforward conflict of good versus evil. This lackluster conclusion undermines what could have been a thought-provoking exploration of survival, morality, and the gray areas of human behavior in a time of war. While the arc begins with an engaging premise and moments of genuine tension, it falters by failing to fully explore the psychological and emotional depth of its characters. Unfortunately, this struggle for resolution is not an isolated issue in The Horizon. As the story progresses, similar patterns of underdeveloped ideas and missed opportunities emerge. ARC #2: THE DOCTOR The second arc begins with the child duo’s capture by a group of soldiers. Their identities remain shrouded in mystery—who they are, what they want, or whom they serve is never made clear. One thing, however, is certain: their intentions are anything but noble. Before the children’s situation can worsen, the soldiers are swiftly dispatched, and the duo is “rescued” by a man in a suit. The man offers food and shelter in the desolate remains of an abandoned city, providing the children with a fleeting sense of relief. But this sense of safety proves to be conditional, as the man soon makes a chilling request: he asks the children to patrol the city and root out potential intruders. The boy hesitates but ultimately agrees, seemingly recognizing the transactional nature of their new arrangement. The girl, on the other hand, remains wary, her suspicion of the man lingering beneath her cautious demeanor. The man in a suit presents a stark contrast to the “strange man” of the first arc. Unlike his feral predecessor, the man is articulate, composed, and philosophical, embodying a calculated ruthlessness. He operates under a single, cruel tenet: kill those who can kill. His worldview is a product of their war-torn reality, one where morality is stripped down to its barest, most primal form—survival. The children’s responses to this philosophy reveal a growing divide between them. The girl tearfully objects to the man’s ideology, her humanity refusing to accept such a cold outlook. She eventually refuses to accompany him on his patrols, unwilling to be complicit in his violent methods. The boy, however, takes the man’s words at face value. To him, the man seems like a mentor figure—someone who understands how to survive in a world that has shown no mercy. Yet, even as the boy follows the man’s orders, his actions betray a reluctance to fully embrace the man’s philosophy. Rather than killing his enemies outright, the boy opts to pacify and subdue them, clinging to whatever shred of innocence he has left. This moral tension—between the girl's compassion and the boy's pragmatism—adds weight to the arc’s early developments. However, the story takes a darker and more unsettling turn as the girl makes a grim discovery: the meat the man has been feeding them comes from human bodies. It’s a shocking revelation, one that shatters any illusion of stability the children may have had. The girl’s horror compels her to act. She frees one of the man’s prisoners, hoping to reclaim some semblance of morality in an otherwise hopeless situation. This decision, however, sets off a chain of devastating events. The freed prisoner returns with a military force, seeking vengeance against the man in the suit. What follows is a violent confrontation that robs the children of yet another ally—or, at the very least, another fleeting protector. The man in a suit, for all his flaws and questionable morality, is ultimately no match for the forces that descend upon him. Once again, the children are left alone, forced to continue their journey through a world that seems intent on destroying every connection they make. The Doctor arc is a grim exploration of survival, morality, and the cost of compromise in a world without rules. The man in a suit serves as a chilling embodiment of a survivalist mindset pushed to its extremes—a mindset that demands sacrifices of both body and soul. His philosophy, while pragmatic, strips away humanity itself, reducing life to little more than a ruthless equation of predator and prey. The moral divide between the boy and the girl continues to deepen, revealing their opposing ways of coping with the harsh reality they face. The girl’s actions are a testament to her unwavering empathy, even when it places her in danger, while the boy’s pragmatism reflects a growing resignation to the world’s cruelty. Yet even he resists fully embracing the darkness, showing that hope, however faint, still lingers within him. Ultimately, the Doctor arc reinforces one of The Horizon’s central themes: in a world ravaged by war, survival comes at the cost of innocence. Every “protector” the children encounter introduces new moral compromises, forcing them to grapple with the question of what it means to survive and remain human. As the arc closes, readers are left with a sense of dread, wondering how much more the duo can endure before the weight of their world breaks them completely. With this arc behind them, the children’s journey continues, but at what cost? ARC #3: THE GIRL’S BACKSTORY This arc marks the emotional apex of The Horizon—a devastating and profoundly moving sequence that lingers long after it concludes. If you’re reading this review, I strongly urge you to experience this arc firsthand, as no retelling can fully capture the depth of its sorrow. Despite the growing philosophical divide between the boy and the girl, their bond only strengthens, evolving into a tender love born from shared suffering and fleeting moments of solace. Their closeness becomes the emotional anchor of the story, and it’s in the quiet moments of care and vulnerability that their connection shines brightest. Hidden away in the forest, the boy falls gravely ill. In a heartbreaking display of devotion, the girl does everything in her power to nurse him back to health. It’s during this time that the story takes us into her past, revealing her haunting backstory in a flashback arc that cements her as one of the most tragically compelling characters in the manhwa. The flashback begins with the girl and her father traveling aboard a bus with a group of survivors. There’s a fragile sense of community among the passengers, their camaraderie a faint glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak existence. Together, they scrape by, scavenging resources and steering clear of the military forces that loom as ever-present threats. For a moment, it feels like this unlikely group might make it through their ordeal together. But that fragile hope is shattered when an incurable disease begins to spread through the bus. As panic and despair take hold, the reality of their situation grows increasingly grim. The first casualty is an old man, whose death signals the start of a rapid and heartbreaking unraveling. One by one, the survivors succumb—not only to the disease but also to the crushing weight of their hopelessness. The depiction of their descent is unflinching. One of the crew members, overtaken by despair, isolates herself and quietly fades away. It’s a stark reminder of how war doesn’t just kill with bullets or bombs—it erodes the spirit, leaving people to die alone, forgotten. Perhaps the most harrowing moment comes when a family, faced with the devastating realization that their infant has been infected, is forced to abandon their child. The parents’ anguish is palpable, and the scene hammers home one of the story’s central messages: families often bear the heaviest burden in war, their bonds strained or shattered under its relentless cruelty. The tragedy continues as the girl’s father, her sole remaining family, succumbs to the disease. The depiction of his death is raw and gut-wrenching, and it’s one of the rare moments in storytelling that genuinely breaks the reader. Witnessing the girl’s loss and her utter helplessness in the face of it is almost too much to bear. It’s a moment that leaves a permanent scar on both the character and the audience. Yet, amid this despair, the story doesn’t completely abandon hope. The girl’s journey takes on new meaning when she meets the boy. Despite everything she’s endured, the boy becomes her reason to move forward—a source of warmth and light in her otherwise bleak existence. Together, they begin to dream of a life beyond the war, imagining a world of peace and serenity. The sequence that follows is nothing short of beautiful, with the art reflecting the quiet optimism they share. It’s a rare and fleeting moment of reprieve, but one that speaks volumes about the resilience of the human spirit. This arc is a masterclass in emotional storytelling. It strips its characters bare, exposing their deepest vulnerabilities, yet manages to weave in a glimmer of hope without undermining the weight of its tragedies. The girl, though unnamed, emerges as one of the most unforgettable characters in The Horizon. Her backstory is not only one of the saddest I’ve encountered in recent years but also one of the most poignant explorations of war’s collateral damage. The juxtaposition of the flashback’s unrelenting despair with the present-day bond between the boy and the girl creates a powerful narrative contrast. It underscores how love, even in its simplest and most innocent form, can provide a lifeline in the darkest of times. The story’s ability to navigate these emotional extremes with such finesse is a testament to Jeong’s storytelling prowess. While the arc is undeniably heartbreaking, it also serves as a reminder of the resilience and adaptability of the human spirit. Even in a world ravaged by war, where loss and suffering are constants, the bond between the boy and the girl offers a small but meaningful beacon of hope. Their shared dreams of a better future might be fragile, but they are no less profound for it. This arc stands as the heart of The Horizon, elevating it from a simple war story to a deeply human tale of love, loss, and the will to keep moving forward. ARC #4: THE DOWNFALL If the previous arc marked The Horizon’s emotional and narrative peak, then this arc signals its sharp descent. It’s a turning point where the story’s once-meticulous pacing and emotional weight begin to falter, resulting in a frustrating and unfulfilled chapter of the narrative. The arc begins with the child duo reaching what feels like a literal and metaphorical dead end. Despite the looming sense of hopelessness, they push forward, their determination hinting at an ominous tragedy to come. As they sift through the dense, silent forest, they stumble upon something unexpected—another pair of children, a boy and a girl who, notably, do not speak the same language. This initial encounter is a moment brimming with tension. The two duos, driven by mistrust and fear, engage in a tense standoff. Yet, with time and hesitation, they reconcile, creating a fragile yet powerful connection born of mutual understanding despite the language barrier. This sequence opens up immense narrative possibilities: the exploration of cultural or linguistic divides in the face of shared suffering, the formation of a new makeshift family, or perhaps a shared struggle for survival that transcends communication. The potential here is tantalizing, offering a glimmer of hope in a story drenched in despair. But that hope is extinguished in an instant. A missile strike obliterates everything. Three of the children are killed outright. The boy—our protagonist—is the sole survivor. The moment is undeniably devastating. After all he’s endured, after all the fragile bonds he’s forged in a cruel and unrelenting world, the boy is left utterly alone—again. The sequence is painful to witness, but while the emotional devastation lands, it also raises significant frustrations from a narrative standpoint. The suddenness of the missile strike shatters the arc’s potential. The story teases a new dynamic—an exploration of communication, trust, and camaraderie between strangers—only to discard it before it even begins. While it’s clear that Jeong intends to emphasize the unpredictability and indiscriminate destruction of war, the execution feels abrupt and hollow. There’s a difference between a tragedy that feels earned and one that feels rushed. This moment, while heartbreaking, veers toward the latter, leaving the reader with a bitter taste and a sense of narrative waste. From this point, the story takes a darker turn, not just for the boy but for the narrative itself. Broken and without direction, the boy is eventually picked up by the military. The hopeful, morally conflicted child we’ve come to know is replaced by something far more hollow—a soulless killing machine. This transformation, while thematically consistent with the horrors of war, feels sudden and unearned. The boy’s descent into moral oblivion is jarring because it lacks the necessary buildup. The Horizon had previously excelled at exploring the slow, agonizing toll of war on its characters, allowing each moment of despair to breathe and resonate. But here, the pacing accelerates unnaturally. Within what feels like the blink of an eye, the boy is a grizzled war veteran, stripped of the humanity that once defined him. Worse still, the narrative begins to lose its depth. While earlier arcs focused on the intimate struggles of individuals navigating a senseless conflict, this arc raises questions about the war itself—questions that remain unanswered. • Why is the military depicted as one-dimensional antagonists? • Who are they fighting for, and who are they fighting against? • What are the broader stakes of this conflict? These questions hang in the air, unanswered and seemingly unimportant to the story. By sidelining the complexity of the war itself, the narrative feels incomplete. What was once a deeply human and intimate exploration of war’s collateral damage begins to drift into the realm of cliché. That’s not to say there’s no merit in this arc. The boy’s transformation into a soldier could have been a powerful commentary on how war strips individuals of their identity, turning them into tools of violence. The tragedy of his arc—the loss of his innocence, his morals, and ultimately his humanity—has the potential to be deeply impactful. But the lack of buildup and rushed execution undermine what could have been a fully realized, gut-wrenching evolution of his character. The Downfall is aptly named, as it reflects both the boy’s descent into moral and emotional ruin and the story’s decline in narrative cohesion. While the emotional devastation of the missile strike and the boy’s subsequent transformation is undeniable, the rushed pacing and squandered potential make this arc the weakest thus far. Jeong has proven his ability to craft powerful, emotionally resonant moments, but this arc feels like a missed opportunity. The narrative sacrifices its careful storytelling and thematic depth in favor of sudden, shocking developments that fail to feel earned. That said, there’s still room for recovery. The story has shown flashes of brilliance, and if Jeong can refocus on the boy’s humanity and the emotional nuances of his journey, there’s potential for redemption. The Horizon thrives when it delves into the small, quiet tragedies of war—the moments of connection, loss, and resilience that define its characters. If it can return to that strength, the story might yet find its footing. ARC #5: THE REDEMPTION By this point in The Horizon, the boy we once knew—filled with conflicted hope and love—has been reduced to a shell of his former self. Now an old, disillusioned man, he carries the weight of the war’s trauma like a suffocating shroud. His love is dead, his dreams long abandoned, and he exists in a state of numb resignation. Time has turned him into an emotional husk—a broken man who’s only remaining routine is to sulk, eat, and wait for the inevitable embrace of death. It is a bleak existence, and for a time, it seems as though the man’s story will end as tragically as it began. That is until fate intervenes. The man encounters a young couple, a rare sight of innocence and life in a world ravaged by destruction. Initially, his instinct—honed by years of survival—is to meet them with hostility. He is armed, ready to act, but something stays his hand. Perhaps it’s the quiet reminder of what he once had, or perhaps it’s the faint flicker of humanity he thought he had lost. Either way, he spares them. The couple, in sharp contrast to the war-hardened man, treats him with kindness. They reach out to him, offering friendship without hesitation, even as the man rejects their attempts. For someone who has spent decades surrounded by death, cruelty, and betrayal, their compassion feels foreign—something he neither trusts nor believes he deserves. This emotional barrier begins to crack when the man’s illness is revealed. He, like the girl’s father from the earlier arc, has been afflicted by the same devastating disease that destroyed her family. It is a cruel twist of fate, a final reminder of the war’s lingering effects on those who survived it. The revelation adds a sense of inevitability to the man’s arc: even if he has endured, the war continues to haunt his body and soul. Yet, despite this, the couple refuses to abandon him. Their kindness is unwavering. They treat him not as a monster or a relic of the past but as a human being—someone deserving of care, empathy, and love. Slowly, the man’s defenses begin to crumble. The pivotal moment comes when the man, now emotionally thawing, saves the young husband from drowning. This act is symbolic—more than just a physical rescue, it represents the man’s first step toward redemption. For the first time in decades, he chooses to protect life instead of taking it. It is an act of selflessness that shatters the shell he has built around himself, allowing the remnants of his humanity to finally resurface. What follows is a profound and cathartic transformation. The man becomes a grandfather figure to the couple’s daughter, watching over her as she grows up. It is a simple life—free from violence, loss, and despair—but it is precisely what makes it so poignant. After years of enduring the horrors of war, the man is given the one thing he never thought possible: peace. The final sequence of The Horizon is both heartwarming and deeply moving. The man, once a broken, hollow survivor of war, finds redemption through love and connection. The young family becomes a beacon of hope, a testament to the idea that even in a world destroyed by conflict, kindness and compassion can rebuild what was lost. The ending stands in stark contrast to the story’s earlier bleakness. It refuses to succumb to cynicism and instead delivers a powerful message: healing is possible, even for those who have suffered the most. The war may have stolen the man’s innocence, love, and hope, but it did not extinguish his capacity to find meaning again. The Redemption arc serves as a fitting conclusion to The Horizon. It beautifully ties together the themes of war’s cruelty, the enduring strength of human connection, and the possibility of salvation. After a series of arcs that often ended in tragedy, this final chapter feels earned. It does not erase the pain of what came before, nor does it pretend that the scars of war simply vanish. Instead, it offers a quiet, bittersweet hope: the belief that even in the aftermath of devastation, life finds a way to continue. The man’s redemption is not a grand, sweeping resolution—it’s subtle, grounded, and more powerful for it. Jeong’s decision to end on such a poignant and serene note reinforces the story’s core message: though war can break people, it does not have to define them. In many ways, this final arc transforms The Horizon from a story about war’s devastation into one about healing, forgiveness, and the redemptive power of love. It’s a masterful ending—one that lingers long after the final panel and leaves the reader with a sense of quiet reflection. CONCLUSION The Horizon is a haunting exploration of war’s aftermath, trauma, and the fragile nature of human connections in a shattered world. At its best, the story shines as a poignant tale of survival and companionship, offering moments of heartbreaking beauty and quiet hope amidst its bleak, nihilistic tone. The emotional weight of the arcs, particularly the girl’s backstory and the redemption arc, hits with devastating impact, showcasing Jeong’s ability to weave a narrative that is both deeply personal and universally resonant. However, The Horizon is far from flawless. Its narrative occasionally falters, most notably in The Downfall arc, where narrative potential is abruptly discarded in favor of shock and despair. The war itself remains frustratingly underdeveloped, with little exploration of its origins, factions, or purpose. This lack of clarity might be intentional—emphasizing the chaotic, senseless nature of war—but it also risks diluting the story’s broader message. Characters and moments with significant promise sometimes feel abandoned, leaving the reader questioning whether certain arcs truly earned their emotional weight. In many ways, The Horizon invites comparisons to Barefoot Gen, another seminal work that portrays war’s devastation through the lens of a child. Both stories depict the horrors of war unflinchingly, refusing to shield their audiences from its brutal consequences. Barefoot Gen offers a harrowing yet grounded perspective on Japan’s wartime suffering, particularly the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While it explores war’s physical destruction and its toll on families, it also roots itself in historical context, providing a powerful condemnation of violence through the lens of real-world events. In contrast, The Horizon operates in a more ambiguous, allegorical space. The lack of historical specificity gives it a timeless quality, making it less about a particular war and more about the universal human experience of loss and survival. Where Barefoot Gen is grounded in history and realism, The Horizon feels more abstract, leaning heavily on symbolism and existential questions. Both works, however, excel in their ability to highlight the tragic cost of war on children—their innocence shattered, their futures stolen, and their lives irrevocably changed. Other media comparisons also come to mind, such as Grave of the Fireflies and Come and See. Like Grave of the Fireflies, The Horizon balances moments of fleeting beauty and tenderness with gut-wrenching despair. Both stories highlight how war disproportionately destroys the lives of the innocent, often forcing children into impossible circumstances. Similarly, Come and See, with its relentless portrayal of war’s repulsiveness, echoes The Horizon’s depiction of violence as a force that dehumanizes and consumes. Ultimately, The Horizon thrives when it focuses on the raw emotional journey of its characters—moments where love, friendship, and survival offer a fragile respite from an otherwise hopeless reality. Despite its flaws, it succeeds in delivering a powerful and reflective experience, one that lingers long after the final page. FINAL NOTE While The Horizon may not match the narrative clarity of Barefoot Gen or the emotional polish of Grave of the Fireflies, it stands as a testament to the enduring power of war stories to confront our deepest fears and hopes. It is a story that reminds us that even in the face of overwhelming darkness, the smallest moments of connection, kindness, and love can carry the greatest meaning. For readers seeking a deeply emotional yet imperfect journey through the devastation of war, The Horizon is a manhwa worth experiencing. It challenges us to reflect on what war destroys, but more importantly, on what it cannot—our shared humanity and the possibility of redemption, no matter how broken we may become."}, {"score": "9", "content": "The Horizon is a well-written and artistically drawn manhwa with heavy nihilistic themes focusing on war and the meaning of life.

I just read The Horizon in one go, I saw that this manhwa was talked about a lot in a good way so I went to read it. I'm kind of disappointed, even if it's still an interesting and pleasant read. In this tragic story centered on two characters, there are real philosophical and existential questions that are asked throughout the work. We meet more or less different characters throughout the work who each have a different vision of life, there are no good or bad, but different thoughts to each. The war is a main subject of the story but the author doesn't explain anything ... about it so I guess he wants us to deduce that the world is cruel not because of the villains but because of our thoughts, our visions, our opinions which are specific to each of us and therefore can create a conflict, We see this when the boy and girl meet another boy and girl who seem to have a similar background but are on the opposite side. Then there is an explosion and the girl and the boy from the opposite side die and the other girl commits suicide. It is especially after the passage that I disliked the story because there is a big jump in time and during all this time the boy has not met anyone, which I find strange. Even if the war killed many people, why didn't the boy have the thought to go forward even if he is all alone? No, he stayed all his life in solitude and finally met a couple and realized that you just have to believe in love. -_- I find the conclusion bland. Apart from that, it's still a very moving and thoughtful story, the main characters are endearing, the graphic style is beautiful and fits perfectly with the story. All that I have just said is my personal feeling and is entirely subjective. my rating would be 6,5/10. I am french and therefore post this review with a translator so sorry about everything is not understandable."}, {"score": "6", "content": "The Horizon This is one of the reasons why reviews should often not be believed. The Horizon is a relatively realistic short story about a war scenario in which a boy and a girl have no choice but to follow their chosen path to the end. The author has made a rather realistic and gloomy theme and scattered a lot of philosophy of life, with thought processes concerning humanity, value and what really awaits you at the end of the road. If I had to choose the best part of it, I would go for the \"bus scenario\", as this was the best presented in terms ... of illustration, message and meaning. But why do I consider this short story only above average? The reasons are simple. It is a short story without any structure and almost every character here feels only the purpose to die for the symbolism. Honestly, I could hardly feel anything because every character you saw died after 1-2 minutes. And since the entire narrative was largely devoted only to representing the author's thought processes, the tension was also gone. [Conclusion] This narration was nice and can possibly be hopeful for some people. Likewise, I find such scenarios interesting anyway, in which one could see from different perspectives, possible human motivations in such situations. But in the end it remains only a short story, which should bring a message. It was slow and far too predictable, you understood the author and the outcome almost at the beginning. At least, if you knew where it was going. [Enjoyment 6]"}, {"score": "10", "content": "This will probably read pretty messy, and i'm sorry for that. With that said, i don't read that much, but i have read a lot of mangas, comics and novels, and none of the have shattered me as much as The Horizon. I've just finished it, i did it in two sessions, one the first volume and now the last 2, and i strongly recommend for anyone to read it in one sitting, although you WILL have to be prepared for what's coming. The way color is used, the pacing of the story, the overall narrative and the imagery, all combine to create what i can only describe ... as a masterpiece, something that i never thought i would stumble on. I would encourage anyone to read this manhwa at least once in their lives, because it truly is a beautiful story, as much as it may look like a nihilistic, pesimistic waste of time at first for some. I'd also like to point out that the length lf this work is just right, without overstating its welcome, well, maybe it's just the shock of having just finished it, but i for sure love The Horizon."}, {"score": "8", "content": "\"Horizon\" is not just a manhwa; it's an emotional journey that tugs at the deepest corners of the heart. Through its pages, readers experience a kaleidoscope of feelings: the hollow weight of emptiness, the drowning waves of sadness, the whirlwind of madness, and amidst all the chaos, the fragile flicker of hope followed by the overpowering shadow of disaster. The protagonist's encounters with various individuals and the heart-wrenching losses that follow add layers to the narrative, making it profoundly impactful. Each character, each interaction, is a reflection of the highs and lows of human existence, making every chapter an emotional rollercoaster. For someone like me, currently experiencing ... the harrowing realities of war, \"Horizon\" hits particularly close to home. It captures the essence of what it means to be caught in a maelstrom of conflict and chaos, and the resilience of the human spirit amidst such adversities. The struggles, the fleeting moments of peace, and the looming sense of doom — they all resonate deeply."}, {"score": "5", "content": "I have read other works from this author expecting a similar vibe and beat from them. In particular, I actually read all the way through their previous work 'The Boxer' and the reason I include that is sort of the reason I did not fully enjoy this with everything I list below. Their previous work still carry the same flaws with only fixing the unnecessary length and almost insultingly asinine means of introducing a theme to the plot. However, in doing so, a new issue arises. Art is fantastic, story telling is above average, and I'd still say people should give it a shot worth reading. Though ... for being so highly scored with many people loving this I felt the flaws show even harder on my not even high expectations for this and this mainly has to deal with the element of story-telling. To summarize without spoiler, This is a story from the perspective of a child. The method that they go through this is lack of text and more showing. Then a dissection of blunt philosophical proposition and logistical thinking. Large amounts of pain, suffering, and gore. All to the conclusion of finding hope and answer to it all. Some aspects of how this is done is actually good. Other aspects are actually downright bad to even feeling shoved to get a theme across. ((This is the spoiler section so skip if you rather not know. I will try to keep it vague, however.)) This is from start to finish leading to a religious answer and the journey to get there is rough for the reader. The first chapter very much displays this and the black/white visuals harshly set the tone especially when the violence and awful nature of life is displayed. Brevity is given especially during segments of color to actually help calm the mood. However, this feels more like a trap to make things feel worse when the next tragedy erases the purpose of the given hope right after. This isn't a terrible thing. Depressing stories can be great. But contrived sadness can make readers feel cheated and manipulated. Considering the simplified perspective of a child's eyes with lack of needed lore to be filled and a short story, questions can start coming up that make this feeling apparent or more less than realistic. Bombs explode out of nowhere to cause a tragedy. The world can be empty and free for one moment until a necessary bullet, bomb, or disease is introduced to progress the depression. Characters introduced to be school of thought and taken away by the same method. Even absence of information and time is a trick to make a point with use of absence of plot and doesn't do the overall story any favors. Infact, a word said is \"futility\" when introduced. When enough loss is told, the conclusion is a religious answer for clarity after it all. It becomes even more questionable when bringing on the topics like why ANY of the tragedies even led to how it did. How a war can stretch out as far and vast as it does yet leave no discernable destruction save oceans of dead bodies. How a completely desolate landscape can suddenly become a war zone purely by the one moment they feel the need that a stray bomb hurt or kill someone important. That a world where many are logistical and moral or absolutely not at all. Things that, if you DON'T think about it, make the setting work. That is fine and people might like that, but the removal of realism, the lack of agency, and the very notion of fatalism is a depressing slog of what you can predict from the first chapter. It gets worse when what becomes an emotional chore is put under levels of scrutiny on what even makes sense and only seems fair when the very story itself introduces schools of thought. It can, at worst, feel contrived and even cheap in all ways of method, obstacle, and resolution. Personally for me, the idea used to essentially excuse all the horrible and tragedies as a simple fix and give simple content felt insulting as disempowering as much as it felt meaningless. The theme leads not to a humanistic ending and gives an ending that can be considered not meant for everyone in a bad way. And that's fine, but not a kind of fine for everybody. I'd even say some could feel even religiously or nonreligiously insulted by the journey. Some might find it hopeful, but I could see why others could see an even Nihilistic worldly perspective even with the heavy religious meaning. ((HEEEEY SPOILERS OVER YOU CAN CONTINUE)) So, fact at the end of the day? This was written for particular types of people with a point to be made for it's conclusion and the what it took to get there and what that end is can feel not worth the ride once the reader has been subjected to the suffering for the sake of suffering. It should be worth noting that, looking back on it all afterwards, you should really start to wonder if you were reading a story of suffering or forced to witness and feel despair to make the conclusion more as to what it is, which tends to leave a reader feel apathetic at best or cheated and hurt at worst. If both the creative and talented visuals/storytelling were absent and this same story was done with a less polished work in art, I feel it'd be more obvious when I'm making the minor complaint when it comes to what the story actually is and questionably rushed yet holding quality compared to a majority of Webtoon stories."}, {"score": "10", "content": "(sorry for any mistakes in grammar, I'm not a native speaker and this is my first review) First time I've heard about this manhwa in a YouTube video and just saved it to read later without any idea what it was about.

From the very start you can't take your eyes of the panels, because of how breathtaking the art is. However, it becomes clear really fast how cruel and engrossing the story is.

Author Ji-Hoon conveys to the reader the different ways people respond to disaster in this very tragic, human drama. When lives are on the line, we are asked to prioritise and rationalise our behaviours. Some may murder and pillage, others may attempt to do good, and the rest just want an escape from the pain. The depiction of human struggle is made very clear and evident, in a story about an innocent boy and girl just trying to make it through each day on the road. The artwork does an amazing job in depicting brokenness ... and suffering on a global scale. Multiple panels are outright disturbing and grotesque, highlighting the atrocities people go to in the face of desperation. The entire situation is beyond tragic, and much of it is made possible by the gripping artwork by Ji-Hoon. Besides our two titular protagonists, other characters serve as archetypes of how different personalities respond to the face of disaster. We are introduced to, and then farewell them very quickly. What is most important is the story of the protagonists and how they deal with loss and pain, which is developed incredibly well. Overall, a masterful story by Ji-Hoon, and one that should not be consumed light-heartedly. I would recommend this to anyone looking for something dark and serious, that is not afraid of adult themes. Verdict - Masterpiece 10/10."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I don’t believe in God. Let me start there. Not in heaven, not in divine plans, and certainly not in redemption offered by something greater. But somehow, The Horizon spoke to me in a way only one other piece of media has. This manhwa isn’t just storytelling—it’s a soul laid bare, an unflinching look at the devastation of war, loss, and what it means to find light in a world that’s been swallowed by darkness. The story follows two nameless children, wandering through a wasteland where hope feels like a bad joke someone told too many times. And yet, through them—through their bond, their silence, and ... the fragile moments they dared to keep walking—I felt something I had never felt before and I still don't know what it was. What stunned me most wasn’t just the raw simplicity of the art or the haunting minimalism of the dialogue. It was the way the manhwa demanded I sit with the weight of it. It never asked for my tears, never begged for my pity, and never once tried to force-feed me hope. Instead, it gave me a mirror, a reflection of the human spirit that’s stubborn enough to exist even when all reason says it shouldn’t. For someone like me, who doesn’t find comfort in faith or religious ideals, The Horizon made me feel something holy. Not in a divine sense, but in the way it made me believe in the holiness of human connection. The nameless boy and girl—it’s not their story alone. It’s ours. It’s what we become when everything else is stripped away, when love and grief are all we have left to hold onto. I finished it in one sitting, when it was over, I didn’t know what to do with myself. It’s not often you come across something that makes you question everything and yet leaves you with nothing to answer back. But maybe that’s what makes it a masterpiece. The Horizon doesn’t just tell a story. It asks you to sit with the quiet chaos of being human and dares you to find meaning in the void. And I did. I don’t know how, but I did. 10/10.\""}, {"score": "10", "content": "\"Lord, protect us from all the misfortunes that sinners can bring upon us.

Whatever the aspect, I think Horizon is as close as you can get to a masterpiece. On a technical level, it was simply breathtaking. You don't need a word, a name, a time or a place to feel the despair, the fear, the sadness, the anger that ... the boy feels right up to the end of his story. The drawings, simple but so expressive, accompany the brutality and cruelty of the story with gentleness, delicacy and finesse. Even if, by the grace of God, we've never lived through these horrors, we can only sympathize and accompany the boy and girl as best we can in this atrocious, barbaric world, leaving nothing for anyone. Despite the various moments of happiness and peace, these were unfortunately all too short-lived. Absolutely nothing spared our little protagonist, and that's what makes it all the more tragic. Nevertheless, despite all this, we must keep the faith and fight to survive, because one day, all this will come to an end and we'll be able to find love and peace in our Garden of Eden in this hell.

We will cease to be and be forgotten with time. So why do we live? why do we keep going? The writer ... uses the post-apocalyptic world and themes for us to see in a literal way how a human being goes through difficulties in life and how these experiences shape our understanding and the ways we see life. The whole thing is a metaphor and at the same time a direct message. This is honestly a very beautiful piece of work that was able to convey what it tried to convey from beginning to end. This is a truly masterful piece of art. I think in the end it embodies very well the essence of every human being. The search for that fulfillment that we all look for so dearly in this insane reality called life; in this crazy world we live in. We want that eternal peace that we are constantly searching for. In everything that we do, we are searching for that eternal fulfillment. But this world, this reality, this body, this mind, they keep us bound in this eternal cycle of suffering.

Characters may be scarce within the story, however, each of their impacts are strong and give the reader plenty to think about each step of the way. Highlights would definitely be the chapters involving \"the man in the suit\" and the flashbacks of the girl.

The art style, paneling, lack of words, and introduction of exciting characters all help drive that death and morbid like mood to the manga. I don’t think the ... manga is entirely sad either like there are for sure sad moments in it and some even horrifying moments but I think they do a great job at showing you can find peace afterwards. The horizon is truly like no other mangas; at just 20 something chapters it tells a story that compares to Oyasumi punpun in that way that I couldn’t stop reading. Thanks if anyone read this. Another thing I would like to add on about death but the manga goes even harder towards the end and talks about the death of ones self through the loss of loved ones. This has been tackled before but The Horizon provides such great visuals and dramatic panels for it that it really helps you understand what a person like that really goes through and how they can finally get better. I for one always felt tremendous grief for people who’s relatives died but never got get a glimpse at their thought process at the time.

The meaning should be given to life through actions that battle the absurdist nature of this world. \"The Horizon\" covers the story of a war-torn world, in which a young boy and a young girl stumble upon each other. Both of them obviously have their own baggage of past memories - some move on, ... some can't. Amidst all the violence and horror, they just keep moving forward. They meet a few characters throughout the course of the story, all of which depict the various people affected by their fellow humans, either physically or mentally.

Sometimes you may look at a manga and cringe because of it being overly edgy or its just so unrealistic, but with this manga perfectly portrays the characters so I can empathize with them. Very few manga have been able to portray such deep and contrasting emotions than this.

The only real thing that keeps it from being a 10 in my eyes is that some of the parts towards the start of the manga felt a bit too slow. I also wish there was a bit more to feast my eyes on, such as more about the boy before we met him. Overall: If you like deep, emotional, realistic, character driven manga, than you will love this.

These two works have the same message, but entirely different ways of tackling it. While Grave of the Fireflies puts emphasis on its characters to convey its message, Horizon puts all its emphasis on art to convey its message. And this is what makes Horizon exceptional in its delivery. We're introduced to the bleak reality of Horizon through our main protagonist, \"The Boy\". This boy is thrust into a war torn world where hope is lost. His mother is dead, corpses litter the streets, and the city ... is in tatters. He lost his meaning to life, he lost his hope, and now he's just a walking corpse trudging through the war torn streets, living day by day. This all changes when he meets, \"The Girl\". Both victims of tragedy, both victims of war. Traveling together in this bleak reality in order to find what was lost. This isn't really a unique premise. And to be honest with you, the story and characters in this manhwa are practically non-existent. The story is never fleshed out and neither are any of the characters. They don't even have names. None of the characters do in fact. The main male lead is kind of fleshed out towards the end but in general there's not enough time to get attached to any of the characters. It's a common issue found in a lot of short stories, but what is unique about Horizon is that, that's the point. The characters in this manhwa are entirely replaceable and they're not meant to be unique or memorable in any sense of the word. They're meant to represent a part of humanity, a part of us. And perhaps that's one of the reasons why I never disliked the characters outright. They're not characters, but instead life lessons posing as characters. I can agree that it's an absurd concept to even consider, considering the fact that this is a story with actual characters. But Horizon does not feel like a story, it feels more like art. Art that tells a story of sadness, happiness, despair, hope, and faith. The art in Horizon primarily uses symbolism to convey its story and message, and it's the reason why the story as a whole works. Dull colors such as black, white, and grey are used mostly throughout the narrative. Painting the image of a bleak reality where hope is lost, to which gives contrast to when hope is gained. During moments where characters feel hopeful for the future, your senses are overwhelmed with vibrant colors of yellow, orange, and light blue. The \"colorful\" emotions that the characters are feeling at that moment are what we feel when we experience joy. Our feelings overwhelm us, like how the colors overwhelm the page. And when they lose that hope, the color scheme turns into a darker shade of blue and red to convey their grief. These are the moments that allow you to connect with these otherwise unremarkable characters. They feel \"alive\" not through three dimensional writing, but instead through the art. There are also many symbolistic pieces of art peppered throughout the pages. Images of gravestones, soldiers, skeletons, missiles, flowers, and corpses are some of those pieces that give narrative to what the story is really about. What the message is. One of those pieces in particular, completely sets the tone throughout the entire narrative and you would have to reread or remember certain previous scenes in order to make sense of what everything was really about. That piece is the image of a lamb with a crown of thorns atop its head, bleeding \"red\" blood. Obviously, this is a reference to Jesus from Christianity. But what's brilliant about this image is the underlying message. That \"red\" blood is meant to symbolize a martyr who died for our sins, the sins of humanity. Those who shed \"red\" blood in this manhwa are victims. Specifically the victims of war, violence, hatred, and mistrust. In this way the primary message of the story is conveyed. This story is not that of life or death, but that of humanity's capacity to hate instead of love one another and one's self. This is a story of a \"boy\" and a \"girl\", and it is also story about us. We must come to love one another and have hope, faith, for a better tomorrow. That the road will not end. All in all, this is a brilliantly crafted piece of art. There are definite issues to this title viewing from the normal standpoint of a manhwa / manga critic, but in the grand scheme of things it didn't really matter.

A piece of art that I recommend that you should come view."}, {"score": "10", "content": "People will think why I give this manhwa a 10 rating. And I'm not really sure why either.

Honestly it's the kind of stories where you think \"This is a masterpiece, but I don't really enjoy it\" or also \"it's a masterpiece but I don't know why it is\" it's just so painful. I absolutely liked everything about this manhwa. painful? it is. But no matter how sad you get, it doesn't take away from how good it is. I don't see many critical points, but someone who is more critical in ... the aspects may criticize the characters, since they are somewhat dark and sometimes not very expressive, which leaves you to infer how they really feel.

It's a beautiful read, enjoy it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "The Horizon has a great, albeit bleak, art style that subtly changes depending on the circumstances, the faces of each character effectively communicating what is going through their mind, and what's coming next. This also means that you certainly don't need music to feel the \"sound\" of the pages anyway, it is fantastically translated by the paneling and gritty art! The nihilistic ideas spread throughout the story are fitting but so deeply saddening, a bumpy rollercoaster ride indeed... This story felt like the emotional journey from Fire Punch but expertly made to fit 21 chapters instead. I'd recommend The Horizon to anyone who is willing to.. cut a ... couple of onions ;)"}, {"score": "8", "content": "-translated by Google translator The Horizon is a manga about a boy and a girl, both probably in the worst moment of their lives.

The Horizon manhwa/manga is like no other and really gets us reader hooked and dispatch strong feelings sabout it even thought it's only 21 chapters long, it really make us verklempt."}, {"score": "9", "content": "The Horizon is a short, albeit powerful manhwa written by Jeong Ji-Hoon. It is a story that does not stray from bleak and devastating themes but rather embraces them, which functions to propel the story even more. These themes include: war, life and death, and thankfully, love, hope and moving forward. STORY - 8/10: The story is nothing innovative as it only takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting, which has been done numerous times in the past. However, what differentiates The Horizon from many others is the way the story carries itself. It doesn't just tell you what is happening, but rather beautifully guides its readers into ... its storytelling and atmosphere. It is a concise, yet strong story that serves to deliver its themes, thus permitting us readers to invoke our own interpretations and to hopefully integrate these messages into our lives. ART - 10/10: The art in The Horizon is simple, yet complex. There are beautiful, minimalistic (and sometimes complex) panels that bring me to awe, but may quickly shift into dark, immersive, and heavy panels in only a few pages. The art is not of extraordinary like in many of Inoue's works (i.e., Vagabond.), yet Jeong Ji-Hoon utilizes art in a compelling manner that best suits a grim story such as The Horizon. The art accurately reflects the messages the author wishes to spill to us. CHARACTER - 8.5/10: There are a few notable characters in The Horizon, however, many other characters (i.e., The Strange Man, and the Man in the Suit) were not as fleshed out as the main characters: the Boy and the Girl, respectively. These characters nevertheless still present their purpose in the grand picture of The Horizon. These characters are realistic. These characters live in a post-apocalyptic war setting which only propels them to bear the thoughts and perspectives they already do. They are not perfect but that's what makes them realistic. ENJOYMENT - 10/10: To be completely honest, The Horizon is an amazing read and I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the small world and story Jeong Ji-Hoon's progressively unfolds. I couldn't stop reading through the chapters (if I wasn't already on the brink of my emotions) and cannot recommend it enough for others. OVERALL - 9-9.5/10: The Horizon is a powerful manhwa that portrays its themes and messages exceptionally. It is a breathtaking experience that I recommend you to dive into at least once (it's rather short). Although many may not find fond of such a desolate and dark story, there is still \"meaning\" within the \"meaningless.\" But you'll have to read to find out why."}, {"score": "8", "content": "If you're someone like me who has never read a Manhwa before but want to then this is for you. I will try to convince you (The reader) why it is so: This was my first Manhwa and I can say this with absolute confidence that it was one of the most thought provoking pieces of literature that I've ever read. No but seriously, This is some top tier stuff and honestly I'm glad that this was my first Manhwa. First let's talk about the art, How is it so good? Like seriously this short Manhwa has some of the most haunting and beautiful panels. The Author's ... rough style of drawing accentuates certain scenes and even lends it's power to make the scenes more impactful. The art is quite literally raw yet full of thought provoking emotions. This Manhwa is gorgeous and a treat to look at. And now coming to my second point why this Manhwa was amazing is because of minimal dialogue. Often times, authors clutter pages with so much stuff that it breaks immersion and is hard to read but this Manhwa does not suffer from that. Every single page and panel was expertly crafted and did just what the author wanted and that is to spark fear and emotion into us. Often times there is no dialogue and the characters are just shown moving and doing stuff which is such an engaging experience that I can't get enough of this honestly. The visual storytelling style used here is amazing. All in all, This was honestly a pretty surreal read, To top it off it's so short that it can be read in an hour which further proves my earlier statement as to why this is the perfect Beginner's Manhwa. Please do yourself a favour and read this Manhwa and also Thanks for reading this!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "I never expected to read this but someone recommended it, so here I am. I don’t really have a way with words so please bare with me. Story [9] This manhwa was truly beautiful. It shows the horrors of war and the dark times that come from it, but it also shows that in dark times you must move forward and continue to live. Our main characters are on a journey, searching for the end to the darkness, while on the journey our main characters experience, joy, sadness, anger, hopelessness, and fear. Art [10] The author of this manhwa was really able to convey the emotions and atmosphere during ... times of darkness. Using black and white (most of the time), using messy lines, and drawn in sound affects really contributed to the overall tone and vibe of the story. Character(s) [8] The characters in the story really show what it means to be human. *spoilers ahead scroll down to enjoyment to skip it* Everyone has their own interpretations and thoughts on what they value and their morals. The man from the building believed that he has to kill to protect others, he believed that everything from bacteria to humans are of similar worth and value. The girl, having experienced the loss of loved ones and watching as people sacrificed themselves and their lives to protect others, she really values human life. She would always rather solve a conflict without people getting hurt. The boy, similar to the man, is willing to hurt someone for a loved one. He doesn’t trust people as much as the girl, but he is usually willing to listen to other people. *End of spioilers* Enjoyment [9] As you can tell from what I’ve written, I enjoyed this manhwa, I’ll admit I was confused sometimes but I would usually understand eventually. Overalll [9] Definitely recommend to people, if you are sensitive, I don’t recommend it. It’ll probably make you very sad. Ok thanks for reading and have a nice day/night"}, {"score": "7", "content": "Spoilers ahead I'm convinced that most people reading this were just too distracted by the gorgeous art to see how mediocre this story is. Anyway, I'll get into it without wasting time on a long intro. Art: 9/10 Definitely the best part about the manwha. It's no Berserk but it's almost there; the art is truly and objectively beautiful and the composition is done in this characteristic way that makes most scenes feel very lonely, mainly by contrasting tiny characters with huge detailed backgrounds. I love that effect and if you're as passionate about art as I am, I'd recommend this manwha purely on that basis. Characters: 5/10 They're likeable, ... I won't deny that. The sniper guy and The Girl are especially likeable to me, but likeability doesn't mean good character writing. The character writing is absolutely mediocre; all characters are just archetypes and entirely one dimensional. The female characters are even worse; all of them are either dependent on male characters or leave the story having accomplished nothing at all. For example, I love The Girl but she really just depends on The Boy until the end; the only time she had \"agency\" was when the dude in the shackles literally manipulated her into going against the sniper guy and freeing him. Other than that, she was dependent on her father and the others in the bus until she met The Boy, and then she was dependent on him until she died (I'll get back to that bullshit scene later). The woman in the bus didn't contribute anything at all to the bus community; the men were doing everything. She just got depressed and committed suicide after spending several days lazing around doing nothing at all; we see no character development in her or anything of that kind. The blonde wife we see later also doesn't do anything at all, just depends on her husband to do things and comfort her; she is never seen comforting him btw which I think is kind of messed up. Later, we see the wife with the one eye, she just cries as her husband gets washed out into the sea, doesn't try to save him at all, entirely useless. The male characters are all archetypes too; either they're perverts or protectors of some kind; there are some exceptions like the old men in the story being old men and nothing else really, which is a low bar for character diversity. One extremely easy fix for this whole issue would be making the sniper guy a woman; just keep everything about him exactly the same but make him a middle aged woman instead of a middle aged man, it would have been very unique and creative. Overall, the characters are so mediocre to the point of being terrible. Plot: 6.5/10 It had some strong points I guess. I mainly only really liked the sniper guy's arc, and the strange man's arc was kind of tense I guess. The majority of it didn't really affect me though. It was all extremely predictable; I was never really shocked or surprised by anything except when they showed that the sniper guy was a cannibal; that scene was epic. There are tons of plot holes too; the main one has to do with The Girl's death. She was killed off in the one of the stupidest and most random ways possible. A fucking missile explodes behind this blonde kid, and he shoots The Girl for some reason?? Like why tf? Was that fucker deaf? Did he not hear the missile exploding behind him? Also can we address how absolutely ridiculous it is for The Boy and The Girl to meet another boy and girl exactly like them? I understand that the author was trying to thematically show how war is created, but that scene would be so oddly convenient in-world. Also why the hell did The Boy immediately point his gun at the other kid? We haven't seen him acting in such an impulsive way before. Even given his situation, what kind of person decides to immediately point their gun at another person the millisecond they see them? It's not like The Boy was a soldier or anything, and the boy he pointed the gun towards wasn't a soldier or anything either. Even though the other boy had a gun, it seems unrealistic to me that The Boy would jump to that action. Another plot hole is that dumbass wave that tried to drag that disabled husband to sea. What kind of goddamn wave is strong enough to pull an adult man to see out of nowhere? If waves were really that strong, then no one would go to the beach. That was such a forced and predictable scene; the second those two said \"I love you\" to each other I knew the author was gonna try to kill one of them. Another plot hole is how The Girl didn't get that disease that everyone else on the bus got; that's absolutely impossible considering her father, who had the disease, was always right next to her and usually holding her in some way too. Another plot hole is why the hell didn't The Boy's mother just get into that hole with him? In the very first chapter, we see The Boy's mother hide him in this hole in a wall or something, and that's how he survived while she died, but we see that the hole was definitely big enough to keep both of them inside, so why didn't she get in there with him? There are probably more plot holes I can't remember now. Themes: 7/10 It wasn't bad, but the thematic message conveyed is ultimately quite childish and simplistic. The answer is \"love\"? Alright sure but like, how is that even practically applicable? It can even be argued that a lot of wars are caused by love; for example if two nations in a very arid environment both need water, they might go to war because they don't want to see their respective people die of thirst. Isn't that also love? The analysis of war presented in The Horizon is quite dumbed down; it ignores the complicated socioeconomic and geopolitical tension that happens before any wars start. The philosophy of this story isn't bad, but it's really lacking in comparison to stories that do philosophy really well, like FMAB or Dororo. It's very vague stuff that makes you believe it's deep simply because of how vague it is. Actually good philosophy isn't vague; it seems vague but turns out to be quite logical upon closer inspection, at least in my opinion. Overall: 7/10 I'm only giving it 7/10 because of the Godly art; otherwise it would be a 6/10."}, {"score": "7", "content": "This was very predictable I guess its sorrow dark sad blah blah but anyone with a little bit of literacy on storytelling could predict EXACTLY what was gonna happen *I assure you there was not a SINGLE time where i felt like \"wow didn't expect this\"* i mean its sad but thats kind of it punpun i think just has more build up and feels more realistic ad less predictable the horizon kind of just tried WAYY TOO hard to be deep and what not but it just do'ent come off I cant really explain this in words but there is no like \"base\" for ... the messages to land upon the characters have the same personality of a cardboard box i wont complain much on that it is a plot driven story but my point is the \"deep\" messages really don't have a base of a story and no symbolism like the entire story is literally just the message it dosent a plot or anything outside of that like every and I mean EVERY piece of dialogue and panel only exists to purely serve the message which isnt even all that great i guess if you havent read a lotta these \"deep dark\" manga before then it will be amazing but like it tries way to hard to convince a message and thats its sole purpose my main problem is that it dosent try to bend (mild spoilers) any tropes like the evil strange man is a little child lover ohhh!!! who wouldve guessed that! and the girl refuses to go help her lover and just cries wow what an amazing heroine idk i guess its minor but I'm into stories that convince their messages through symbolism in a fantasy land and dont make it the priority 24/7, regardless of my criticism as a binge read its a solid 8 or 9/10 really depends on how good you know storytelling for me personally it was ok nice read best part it was short the panel flow was GREAT and art was also amazing best part it dosen't have a lotta dialogue and very easy to binge amazing to me ill give it a 6/10 ig this was a very personal review but idaf abt formal language just cant get my feelings out with that"}, {"score": "8", "content": "For much of the run of this series, it felt mainly like tragedy porn. We've all seen stories like this, both in anime and elsewhere: everything goes wrong, people die and are mangled, and it's easy to walk away from it feeling like all the writer wanted to do was make you sad. Up to the last couple of chapters, I would have said it's just that: well done tragedy porn, and no doubt given it a lower score. It's the same problem I had with Grave of the Fireflies, only more gratuitous and without much insight into why things are happening. Frankly, this series ... takes a very dim view of humanity and, accurate though it may be for many, it's not a way to score points with me. There's something more to this, though, and it's not just some really amazing panel layouts in certain chapters, an art style that allows characters faces to say what the little text won't, the occasional brushes with color that bring life to the otherwise often dreary layouts, or the strong found family relationship that pervades much of the series and becomes a sort of life vest to keep you afloat through some pretty rough waters, though all that certainly helps. So, what brings this up to an 8/10 for me? The series did two things that threw me in a good way. First, this series is virtually devoid of exposition. That's no easy task, especially with the general lack of dialogue in this series. That becomes more obvious as characters develop, and it really makes this one stand out. Second, the ending of this series is excellent. It didn't go how I was expecting and it wasn't saccharine, finding a way to make it realistic in this world and for these characters while giving the reader something meaningful to take away. So while I can't say I enjoyed the majority of this read, I can say that it stuck out to me often enough to elevate itself. All this being said, this is not a series I'd necessarily recommend. It's a great work, but much like other series that engage in this kind of terribly dark storytelling for much of their run, it's not for everyone. If you can slog through the very difficult and dark parts of this story (all of which are brilliantly laid out and deftly told), you'll find that it's more than worthwhile to see it through to the end. If you can't, I don't blame you."}, {"score": "6", "content": "I was super excited for this and was looking forward to read it. Because it was really high rated and secondly it was very short. I was wondering why is it so high rated and what is the meaning of the plot. And I am still wondering that (-_-). I really expected a lot from this manhwa but it DISAPPOINTED ME. I know many people will be angry but it's not like I care that much. STORY: 6/10 The main plot of this manhwa i.e the tragic backstory and life of a boy who is suffering to survive in a world war or pandemic who meets a ... girl and they both try their best to stay together, is really good. Like for this I give a solid 8.5 out of 10. BUT. That's not the case with the actual storyline that is shown in here. The main problem I have with it is that SO MANY important things are left unexplained! That's what makes this story just FINE. I cannot tell some of them because it will spoil others. But those SHOULD be explained. Like what started the war? Why was there no one anywhere? etc. Then there is almost NO text. I know it is unique, that's the style, my brain is smol to understand it and that crap but bruh if you take all the text in the whole series then even my class 3rd essays would have more text(lol). And that's the reason most of the things left unexplained. And the unexplained things make it look like the whole world is just meaningless and also is survival. And you can also just consider the fact that I like and prefer Anime over ebooks. But the ending sure was satisfying. I mean I am happy that it didn't end with everyone dying or something. That's the reason it is 6/10. Moving on, ART: 9/10 I'll be honest here. The art was really good. It perfectly suited the theme. Like the use of only black and white even if it's a manhwa, those crazy lines and strokes that show the depression and also I loved it when the characters were enjoying their life, it turned into coloured from black-and-white. And yeah I really feel bad that I didn't enjoy a manhwa with such awesome art. That's why it's a 9/10. CHARACTERS: 6/10 I neither found the characters that great nor that bad. They were just decent. A 6.5 out of 10. I can't talk much about the characters here. Because i can spoil others if I do. And I guess there can't be much info about characters in just twenty-one chapters :). ENJOYMENT: 3/10 As I said earlier while I was talking about the art, that I am sad that I didn't enjoy a manhwa with such great art. Somehow it just didn't interest me. Yeah, it was boring. It felt kinda like a compulsion while I was reading it. And I think that stories that are sad mostly are better in the form of Anime and not Manga. Not only sad but literally stories of any genre are mostly better if they are adapted into an Anime (and I sure accept the fact that there are some Manga that are a lot better than their adaptations). Although personally I say that The Horizon will be better as an Anime. OVERALL: 6/10 Overall it was just fine. I don't feel like giving it more than six. The one thing which hurts me the most is that most things are left unexplained, like even the most necessary ones. If they were not then I would have given it something like a 7 or even 8. (PLEASE DON'T KILL ME FOR NOT LIKING IT LOL)"}]}

By far the strongest aspect of this series is the pacing, it's smooth, taking its time to get us familiar with the characters, building up on small moments. The characters are fun & lovable, the art is super clean however the series definitely lacks depth. Now of course with their only being 23 chapters as of now I can’t really ... comment on that too much, but I hope the series explores the characters more and starts to thicken the plot because right now the series is very one dimensional.

Nevertheless, this manhwa grabbed my attention within the very first chapter or two, and I couldn’t find a single flaw that would make me drop it. Honestly, I might even dare say it’s perfect. Manhwas are often known for having beautiful artwork, but this one goes above and beyond. The art is absolutely stunning, every ... single character is drawn so beautifully. It even reminds me of The Extra’s Academy Survival Guide, which is one of the few works I’ve read with art on a similar level. But it’s not just the visuals, the plot is refreshingly unique for a romcom. It starts with a guy who always takes the same late train home as a girl. Because of their busy days, they both end up waiting for the last train together. One day, she notices he listens to music, the very music she herself creates. Instead of revealing the truth, she plays along, pretending to be just another fan. From there, their story begins. Every chapter that follows is fun, adorable, and hilarious.

{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/132214/Omniscient_Readers_Viewpoint", "reviews": [{"score": "10", "content": "Ahh this seems to be a new addition in here and I was WAITING for this to be added. Note that the webtoon just recently released a few months back and I will be writing my review for the 36 chapters I have read, not the webnovel. So let's get to it now, my review might be a bit too long with some spoilers. STORY: 10/10 This starts off with a simple yet exciting plotline that many readers might be able to relate to. Our MC here is an avid reader of webnovels and he followed one of them in particular called \"Three Ways to survive the apocalypse\" ... for 10 years religiously seeking a distraction from worldly matters. The intriguing part kicks off the moment he finally finishes reading it with the message, \"There are three ways to survive this apocalypse. Everything is fading and becoming unclear now. But one thing is certain, if you're reading this, you will survive\". He was the the sole reader. Then at once, everything came to a standstill. Fiction became reality. It's basically this huge Jumanji mixed with Hunger Games. Except the entire world has fallen prey to it and only the MC knows how the plot goes. Oh and did I mention that the whole world has now become a huge streaming service for the entertainment of celestial beings? The story continues to get more and more and complex and interesting as it goes on but I'll leave that for you to discover. The world building here is *chefs kiss*. Power System is extremely well thought out. ART: 10/10 From the same studio that did the art of Solo Leveling, need I say more? CHARACTER: 10/10 (100/10 if I could) The Characters CARRY. Kim Dokja the mc. The story at first leads you into believing that he's a naive and clumsy guy. I mean, what would you expect from someone who failed multiple exams getting enrolled into a third rate college and still struggles with work, seeking happiness from reading a web novel throughout his life. It becomes quite apparent once the apocalypse begins though, that he is NOTHING like that. He stands at this very fine line between good and bad, that he could even be considered a realist. That should be the case for a 28 year old man. He does what has to be done to survive. He's cunning and manipulative as well, leads you to wonder why he did not become a businessman! Surely with his intellect and memory power, he would not have performed this badly at life? Turns out later in the story that there is more to him that meets the eye. It has not been covered completely in the webtoon yet, but I must say I'm hooked. It's never dull when he's on the scene, bringing out new and innovative ways to clear each scenario, a method that you might have never expected. It's not even about overpowering the difficulties, it's about outsmarting them. I should mention that while Kim Dokja is the main character, there is a true protagonist, the one who was the actual protagonist of the webnovel he read. Funny thing is, this character would more suit the OP af, good looking trope that protagonists of fantasy genres like these have. The side characters are great as well. They are a mix of the characters that Dokja actually read about in the webnovel plus characters that are exceptions. Each character has their own specialty, personality and traits and they grow in their own ways. Some mysterious characters included. Their interactions are a treat to read especially. It would take a hundred years if I have to describe each of them so let's leave it at that. ENJOYMENT: 10/10 The comedy here is surprisingly top tier! It has a very dark and gritty start, so the comedic scenes feel very welcomed and also natural. No fanservice involved, so that's a plus point. Keep an eye out for the viewers of this grand show too, they keep this webtoon very lively with their reactions. I'm enjoying this quite a lot so far and I would really recommend you to check this out for yourself whether you enjoy this too or not! OVERALL: 10/10 Yes yes I know that this has been a completely positive review. Unfortunately, I'm unable to find any glaring flaws in this media. If there are any, it was easily ignorable. ORV has high potential, and from what I've heard from the reviews of the webnovel, it doesn't fall of in quality but rather rises in it. The biggest negative I would say is that this is addictive, so I suggest waiting for more chapters to pile up before beginning instead of committing my mistake. Another little flaw is that the pacing is a bit slow, but I'd say that is good since this is a plot heavy manwha and a lot of the information in the beginning is relevant later on so rushing through the concepts won't help. TL;DR Read Omniscient Reader and see if it is your cup of tea! I do not think you would regret giving this one a shot!"}, {"score": "7", "content": "Okay. Here's the thing. I absolutely adore Omniscient Reader. The webnovel is easily beside my favourite novels/series like Les Miserables and Lord of the Rings. Seriously. The novel is just that good, and I honestly, wholeheartedly recommend reading the novel if you're someone who loves stories and great characters. There are a lot of impactful and heartbreaking moments in the book, and it moved me to tears both while reading it and thinking about it. So yeah. I love this novel. But then why did I only rate the webtoon a 7? The thing is that Omniscient Reader is a story told from an unreliable point ... of view---throughout the story, Kim Dokja is constantly misleading the reader, hiding things from you, and thus you rely on the other characters who are more concise and clear with intent (Yoo Joonghyuk, Han Sooyoung) to fill you in on what he may have left out of the narration. Kim Dokja does not like conveying his emotions, he wants to *appear* like a calm and level headed leader who totally knows the best course of action, but the narration of other characters, the fourth wall, and even his own views on himself betray this. It shows you just how lonely he is and how lowly he views himself, and why he has no value for his own life, and why he is willing to throw away his life for his companions (because they are his everything). The point of view changes in this novel can let you into how the others view the world, and how Kim Dokja actually felt during a certain moment. On top of this, it lets you know what other characters might have been during between periods of time (ex. When YJH threw KDJ into the Han River during the itho-im not spelling that-saur scenario, he actually came back to the bridge and waited for him for 3 days). The webtoon chooses to focus almost entirely on Kim Dokja, and the effect of an unreliable narrator loses all of it's meaning when you can see the action rather than having to trust Kim Dokja to accurately describe what is happening. I think that the loss of the unreliable aspect of the novel, combined with the fact that you don't really read all of his thoughts, I can get why people don't think his motivations make sense, because his motivations lie within his constant commentary, and the rumblings of the fourth wall or the viewpoint of another character help further your knowledge of his character. As a result, I think his webtoon counterpart lacks depth that his original webnovel self had. Removing the context of Kim Dokja's thought process and ramblings, it makes webtoon Kim Dokja come off as flat sometimes (not all of the time, but definitely certain moments where he had plenty of internal dialogue reduced to a few sentences). I also feel like the reader loving the story metaphor is lost in other forms of media, and that is why I fear the release of the movie to be honest...with the webtoon, those elements are completely removed since you can't hear all of Kim Dokja's thoughts and the thoughts of other characters, and I feel as if it focuses entirely on the action instead. Also, the addition of new characters (like that one dude from the peace land arc, whom I cannot recall the name of. in the novel it was just Asuka Ren, which ties in to the theme of authors and readers loving the stories that they make, and the peaceland arc was way longer now that I think of it) is something that I believe to be unnecessary. The art is amazing, beautiful colours and clean lineart, and some panels are so beautiful I'd frame them if I could tbh... But other than that, as a reader of the novel and the first person to sing it's praises to the highest point in the Alps, I think that the original meaning and overall emotional impact of the novel is lost in the webtoon because of the lack of external narration and because Kim Dokja is no longer an unreliable narrator. Thanks for sticking around!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Omniscient Reader isn't the first manhwa to bloom outside its home, few others managed to do the same but what separates it from the rest is the fact it's very unique and I've personally never read anything like this ever before Story : Incredibly immersive and Exciting with amazingly written lore. The manhwa starts with our protagonist Dokja realising that web novel he has been reading for years is the reality now. Apocalypse striked, the world has fallen but he knows how to survive and what will happen next. He was a reader, reader he still is, but a reader who knows it all. The characters ... he read about in the novel are reality but what about the original protagonist of the novel !! Strange creatures began to appear who seem nothing more than the typical Streamers broadcasting the death game to some higher beings called the constellations. The whole world is like a playfield and we're nothing more than pawns for the entertainment of higher beings. The narration in the manhwa is extremely fluid and feels as if you're reading a book despite not being much text-ish. Characters : I appreciate the fact our main character Kim Dokja isn't some naive person or takes tons of chapters to come in terms with the reality and I expect nothing less than a 28 year old person. He tries to take full advantage of all the knowledge he has after reading the novel for all those years. He gathers allies who will prove useful and help each other to survive this world and they're all decently written too Art : Story is what that matters the most but a great art is always a bonus. The manhwa has absolutely fantastic artwork, and it's done by REDICE Studio which does art for Solo Leveling too Comedy : It's not really a focus but it has its moments. The constellations aka the higher beings are like viewers and their reactions are always a pleasure to read. They give the same vibe as seeing reaction videos. Overall : A great manhwa where the art is stunning but it's the fantastic plotline and story that carries the show."}, {"score": "10", "content": "FINALLY!!! Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint has finally made it to MAL! This is one of the few series I can preach about until I completely convert the listener. And that is because I found ORV to be completely FLAWLESS! Omniscient Reader is a pretty refreshing addition to the list of manhwas with OP MCs because now we finally have an MC who is BY NO MEANS OP in physical strength. His utilisation of knowledge and wits to adapt to the world, deviating from the one he read about in the web novel, is what makes this story interesting. ... Story: 10/10 ORV starts with a simple concept but quickly becomes interesting because of its intricate world-building and attention to detail. The protagonist, Kim Dokja, observes the world around him plummeting into an apocalyptic web novel he's been reading for years. As the web novel's sole reader, he knows more about the world than anyone else around him. Thus, he has the golden opportunity to turn the outcome of the events around him in his favour. Something worth mentioning - This apocalypse is a streaming service to certain celestial beings called constellations, who sponsor the characters they enjoy watching. They keep the story lively and also help the reader view the scenarios though different perspectives. Each chapter of ORV satisfies no matter where in the arc you are, and every chapter delivers the right amount of humour and seriousness. Art: 10/10 ORV is illustrated by the same studio that illustrates Solo Leveling. So, needless to say, the art here is one of the best out there. Characters: 10/10 None of the characters in the story come across as hollow. ORV has portrayed its characters so well that it puts many series to shame in such a short number of chapters. The protagonist, Kim Dokja, is a realist. He is neither too evil nor too good and can adapt to the situation as required. The way Dokja handles scenarios and outsmarts them never fails to amuse the reader. However, even our seemingly invulnerable protagonist has his own secrets, making his character even more interesting. The side characters are amazing too as none of them seems lacking and they all seem to be growing well with Dokja. All of them have unique personalities, and Dokja's party manages to cover almost all different types of characters. The character interactions are precious, and one can never get enough of them. None of the interactions comes across as forced or wasted, which is a rare sight in this genre. Enjoyment: 10/10 The comedy here is better than any other similar webtoon out there. The story has its dark moments, and the comedy helps relax the mood. The constellation reactions are pretty fun too, and they keep this webtoon lively with their reactions on every event in the story. Seeing Dokja mess around with the minds of his viewers is absolutely hilarious! Overall: 10/10 No second thoughts here. I've been waiting for this series to be added to MAL for months to leave my absolutely positive review. This series is as close to perfection as a story can get. There are no plotholes or flaws in the story, and that is something you can't find anywhere else. ORV has a very positive review from the web novel readers, so don't expect it to lose its charm anytime soon. TL;DR Give ORV a shot. Anyone who's into adventure or isekai and isn't reading ORV is missing out on a lot of fun. Thanks for bearing with this essay of mine! I could preach more, but I don't know when to stop. Take it from me: If Solo Leveling gets a successful anime adaptation, this series will DEFINITELY get an anime adaptation."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Both an incredible manhwa and light novel. Based on the LN of the same name omniscient reader is one of the best reads of the modern era. I truly recommend to anybody who is interested in fantasy even though it is not particularly over the top. I think explaining the plotline only hinders at your enjoyment so i suggest going in blind. Give it 5 manhwa chapters and if you're not hooked its not for you. Brief Synopsis: Our protagonist is an average salary man who loves his light novels. During his childhood he follows a certain one for an extended period over multiple years until ... current day. After work on the day of the final chapter release he is met with a sudden change; the world has descended into chaos only its a very familiar one."}, {"score": "9", "content": "The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint is one unique manhwa in the webtoon and graphic novel world. Adapted from the same-named, popular Korean web novel, this adaptation takes its original work to a whole new level with a visually engaging experience that amplifies its narrative depth. The story revolves around Kim Dokja, an ordinary office worker who becomes an unwitting player in a mysterious and perilous game that mirrors the web novel he has been obsessively reading. The unique premise—where the protagonist's deep knowledge of the novel's plot becomes both his greatest asset and his biggest burden—sets the stage for a gripping and multifaceted narrative. The artwork is one ... of the highlights of this manhwa. Colorful and energetic, it perfectly complements the intensity of the story. The character designs are unique and full of expression, which enables readers to relate more to the characters. The action scenes are one of the best-executed parts, as the movement is fluid, and the backgrounds are highly detailed to set the reader right in the middle of it all. But then again, its pacing goes from fast action to that of introspective moments perfectly, and the story is gradually revealed with suspense and intrigue while keeping readers on the edge of their seats. And the character development is smooth: Kim Dokja's growth internally was sensitive and deep. Relating this to other characters added layers to the story and made it more than a simple survival game. The manhwa, though, does a good job of explaining the complex mechanics in the world of the game without going overboard. This world-building is thorough and imaginative, drawing readers into a setting that is as captivating as it is dangerous. Overall, The Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint manhwa adaptation is really something else: It brings a great novel into being with the best artistry and storytelling. It also breathes new life into the common genre of isekai with its fun and thought-provoking storyline. High-stakes adventure mixed with intricate plots-for fans wanting the same, this manhwa comes highly recommended for the guaranteed action and emotional depth it aims to deliver. Highly recommended: read the novel, too."}, {"score": "10", "content": "\"This is the story of a reader\" So I'm caught up to the manhwa and I've also read a decent portion of the light novel (chapter 459) and I've got to say, this series is shaping up to be one of my favorites of all time. *Note, this review contains very minor spoilers, but I've tried to mark them as best I can.* The story begins with our main character Kim Dokja who is your average 28 year old office worker who has a hobby of reading web novels. There's one web novel in particular that he has been following for the past 10 years called 'Three ... Ways to Survive the Apocalypse' or TWSA for short. He is literally the only person who has read this particular novel and after reading the final chapter, the story starts to happen in reality. Story 10/10 - Did I mention how meta this webcomic is? The story of this webcomic is unlike anything I've ever read before. There are so many mysterious things about the world building and power system that shouldn't make sense, but then make perfect sense in context. On the surface, the plot may seem a bit generic, but it turns into one of the most beautifully convoluted masterfully written plots that I've ever had the honor to read. The author perfectly combines so many details together for many different popular genres to create a product that is original, entertaining, and a delicious gourmet dish of a read (a delicious story as Persephone would put it). [MINOR SPOILERS (chapter 8)] Imagine something like Squid Games mixed with Percy Jackson, where the entire world is forced to compete in these death quests called 'scenarios,' but the twist is that the entire thing is being live streamed to celestial beings who watch for their own amusement. These beings (known as constellations) can gift their favorite humans/participants (known as incarnations) with coins which can be used to get more powerful (video game style). Art 10/10 - This should come as no surprise, but Sleepy-C putting in the WORK to make each and every panel glow with quality. The art is consistently detailed and beautifully drawn, to the point where almost every image is wallpaper material. The art keeps improving as you continue to read. My god, Dokja's feather coat in chapter 105 is 'chefs kiss' Characters 11/10 - I think the characters are really where this story shines (especially as you get farther into the light novel). Our MC Dokja (which means reader in Korean) is the cold and calculating kind, but not to the point where you get annoyed at him. He still cares deeply about his companions as well as the characters that show up from TWSA (yes, the characters from the novel that Dokja was reading show up, including the protagonist of the novel, who is one of my favorite characters). The large cast is diverse and most of the characters get lots of on screen development. Hell the novel gave more personality to a fricken video game skill than some anime give to their entire cast. I've also got to give a shout out to the female characters in this story. There are so many stong and smart female characters who receive their own developments and over come their own obstacles apart from the main character. However, by far one of the most striking character relationships is the dynamic between our MC, Kim Dokja, and the protangonist, Yoo Joonghyuk. Kim Dokja is a person who has followed the story of Yoo Joonghyuk through out his struggles and rooted for him along the way. [MINOR SPOILERS (chapter 11-12)] - Dokja himself clung to TWSA as a coping mechanism to help him through school bullying and deep depression. He essentially used this series as a life line. Imagine having that much admiration for a fictional character and being able to meet him in real life!......the only problem is he wants to kill you cause he has PTSD and is now a soulless bastard with trust issues. As Dokja interacts more with the protagonist, their relationship naturally develops which is so satisfying to watch. Enjoyment 11/10 - I laughed, I cried, I felt anxious when the characters were in tight situations, I felt pride as they found ways to break the system and thwart their enemies. I especially related to the main character's passion for reading. The way the author explains the thoughts and feelings of a reader hit me deeply and had me staring at my bedroom wall for well over an hour. Last thing I want to highlight is the way the story keeps the reader in the dark about a lot of things, revealing small tasty crumbs of information throughout the novel until you get to a big reveal and you're like, \"wow, now I have to read the entire series again with this piece of information.\" Overall 10/10 - I wholeheartedly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading and has a big imagination. Go into the series open minded and enjoy the ride!"}, {"score": "5", "content": "This story is the peak of deus ex machina(a.k.a Random BS Go!!!) if I've ever seen one. Almost every conflict and problem is resolved by introducing a new element or character instead of with wit and determination. None of the characters hold any weight in the grand scheme of things. You just know that some new BS plot armor will save the day no matter what. The world-building is a huge mess that lacks any consistency and logic. Again, new elements and characters keep getting conveniently introduced and immediately dropped/killed off once they're no longer useful to the plot. Even the leveling in the game ... system is a unsalvageable mess. I mean, gathering stories to gain power is a truly unique concept, but... I'm a sucker for the \"game-like\" and OP MC trope but this is just not it. I had planned to keep reading the manhwa till I'm caught up with the latest chapter then continue reading the novel but I don't think I can make it that far. Edit: OK so I lied. I went on to read the novel, thinking that it should be better than the manhwa (novels are always better, right? Right??), and I actually made it to 60% before finally giving up. It really didn't get better... In fact, the Random-BS-Go got even more random, and the BS grew to ES (Elephant S). Entities from the whole universe b*tching on social media all day long bla bla bla, lack of \"Probability\" bla bla bla, swinging gianormous and micro stories in each other's faces bla bla bla.

This is going to be fun! First off, let me just say that this manhwa is like a rollercoaster ride. It's got its ups and downs, its twists and turns, and sometimes you're left wondering what the heck just happened. But hey, that's what makes it exciting, right? Now, let's get into the good points. The artwork is absolutely stunning. The characters are beautifully drawn and the action scenes are epic. Plus, the story is pretty unique. I mean, who wouldn't want to read about a guy who can see everything that's happening in a novel? But, as ... with anything, there are some bad points. For one, the pacing can be a bit slow at times. And sometimes the plot can get a little convoluted. But hey, that's just my opinion. Now, let's compare and contrast. When compared to other manhwas in its genre, Omniscient Reader Viewpoint definitely stands out. It's got a fresh take on the isekai trope and the artwork is top-notch. However, when compared to other manhwas in general, it can fall a bit short in terms of pacing and plot. So, what's my suggestion? Well, if you're a fan of action-packed manhwas with stunning artwork and a unique premise, then I definitely recommend giving Omniscient Reader Viewpoint a shot. But if you're looking for something with a bit more consistent pacing and a straightforward plot, then maybe give it a pass. Overall, I'd say that Omniscient Reader Viewpoint is definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared for a wild ride!"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Honestly, I almost feel bad giving orv (Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, the original name of the webnovel) 10s in all categories because it makes it seem like I didn't think to criticize it at all, but it's really just because this series is genuinely one of the all time best, especially of those to come out recently. Story - 10/10 Omniscient Reader's premise might seem simple or generic at first glance (basically reverse isekai), but the amount of detail placed into building an expansive, specific, and creative world brings it up to levels that are completely unmatchable by others in the same genre. It's somewhat complicated because ... the reader is thrown straight into it without much hand holding, but put in a little thought and you should get it--what I'm saying is that this is one where you can't just shut your brain off and enjoy the ride if you want to get everything out of it. The plot is an absolute masterpiece. Speaking from a novel reader's experience, this story will make you laugh, cry, scream, and smile so hard like so little stories manage to do. And, the future twists are nigh impossible to predict on your first read through, but the massive amount of foreshadowing the authors added in, even from some of the first few chapters, becomes obvious during a reread. It's a clearly well thought out story, where each moment builds to something greater. You're in for a wild ride. And the themes! I'm such a sucker for stories that put in the effort to really nail down a lesson they want to impart on their readers, and orv is one of those. It plays with morality, depression, sacrifice, salvation, and more with the weight those topics deserve. Honestly, a story that changes lives. Art - 10/10 It's made by Redice studio, so it's obvious it's good, and they do such a great job getting across the emotions of the story, as well as the action. Character - 10/10 These are the absolute highlight. Kim Dokja, the main character, is so complicated in the best way possible--a far cry from other male power fantasy self inserts. He's smart, witty, hilarious, and a massive scammer, which makes for an entertaining narrative. But beyond that, he's nuanced. He plays into the moral grey trope like many other protagonists but is ruthless enough that he counts as possibly \"a bad person\" but so clearly emotional enough that he doesn't come across as annoyingly edgy. The webtoon has only just been digging deeper into his true personality and past--with the more that's uncovered, the more you understand him as a person that's conflicted and hurting in a way that comes across as painfully realistic. As the novel reader fans agree, are you really an orv fan if you don't both want to strangle Kim Dokja and hold him in your arms? The side characters are just as amazing, and that's so rare in these types of power fantasy stories (though this actually isn't one). They don't exist just to make kdj (Kim Dokja) look cool, they all have their own interesting personalities, morals, drives, and stories--they exist beyond what they are to kdj. ESPECIALLY the women. If you're looking for a series with a strong female cast that kick ass and own their femininity without being some guy's accessory, this is your story. Enjoyment - 10/10 This is such a fun story on top of all of the nuance, with great humor, amazing fights, incredible twists, and wonderful characters. It might be a little slow, but it's worth it to spend all that time in this world with these people. Overall - 10/10 I can't sing the praises of this story enough. There's barely a single thing I can have gripes with, and those that aren't masterpiece level are easily ignorable. It's a story that I recommend to everyone--especially to those who love to read or have been saved by reading. This one resonates. Truly, it's deserving of the #1 most popular Korean webnovel. TL;DR READ THIS STORY GOD IT'S SO GOOD"}, {"score": "9", "content": "I absolutely adore this manwha. This is by far my favorite out of all the overpowered mc/solo-leveling genres of stories. While most of the aspects of the story can be pretty generic, I love the pop culture references the author includes. I remember audibly squealing when they referenced the Survive! Mola! Mola! phone game. I loved that game when I was younger and it was really cool to see it referenced. There are also a lot of allusions to western media (especially movies) that are really cool. There are many other cool references but you should really read it to find ... out. :3"}, {"score": "7", "content": "Story: 7/10 The concept of the plot itself is pretty straightforward- the story from a novel get brought into real life, and there is just one guy who's read the whole book and knows what will happen, beginning to end. What's great about ORV is how it presents its story. The main character, Dokja, is, as the title says, all-knowing. As a \"reader,\" he knows what's going to happen in the story ahead of time (well, most of it, anyway.) The twist is that we, as the real readers, don't know anything about the book Dokja's read. So we have to piece together story details from ... the bits and pieces of the plot he references in his thoughts. It's a really interesting concept because, unlike most books and movies and manga, the MC knows MORE about the story than the reader does. It's a unique storytelling technique, and it's complimented by the lack of information provided to the reader about the story, ORV just jumps right into the main plot with barely any exposition. It's kinda challenging, and a lot of the time you'll just be wondering... \"WTF is going on.\" But trust me, whatever crazy bullshit happens, it is always going according to the author's plan. The dialogue is decently funny and the characters are memorable. The story takes a lot of inspiration from Korean culture and history which I thought was really interesting. There's a bunch of pop culture references thrown in there too, some that Western fans will recognize, and others that might not be so familiar. I also love how the protagonist of the manhua ISN'T the protagonist in the novel he read, so he constantly plays second fiddle to the real \"main character\" of the story, a guy named Yoo Joonghyuk. Yoo Joonghyuk is a total Mary Sue (or Gary Stu, the male version of the term.) He's perfect in every aspect, a chick magnet with roguishly handsome looks, and a badass who's good at everything he does. Nothing like Dokja, who's a \"plain-looking\" dude with an average build and a boring backstory. The rivalry between Dokja and the \"real\" main character is a major plot thread in the manhua. The main downside to ORV's story is that it's too afraid to escape from the cliches of its genre. Even though Dokja's not supposed to be worthy of being a \"main character,\" he IS an overpowered badass, just like Joonghyuk. The author wants us to believe Dokja is just an ordinary guy, the underdog of the story, but it's nothing more than an illusion. Dokja is bold, super strong, a born leader, extremely talented, and pretty good-looking (even though everyone in the story claims he isn't). He (almost) never suffers from internal conflict and his plans always go his way. The line separating Dokja and Joonghyuk starts to blur as the story progresses, and at some point, you're gonna end up feeling like Joonghyuk isn't the Mary Sue of the story- Dokja is. Art: 10/10 Outstanding art in every chapter, beautiful colors and amazingly detailed panels. The only thing I have to complain about are the fights. I guess my problem isn't exactly about the art but I'll put it here anyway. The fights in ORV are really plain, just generic punches and kicks for the most part with some sword swinging and whatnot. I wish the more unique skills in ORV got more screentime, and it really sucks how the fights are so boring because the art is so good. Character: 7/10 I really appreciate good character development, and while ORV is sparse in developing its characters, it does a good job when it does. The characters are people with flaws and realistic motivations, and they're well-rounded and believable. The author makes use of humorous moments and bonding scenes to bring characters together as well. The only character I have a problem with is the main character, Dokja, who is way too perfect to be interesting. His special skill (literally named Fourth Wall) protects him from trauma, ensuring he's never too shocked or overwhelmed or confused by any situation. This is because the skill essentially makes him \"experience\" the story as a reader, rather than as a character in the story. As a result, it's hard to see him as a genuine person. He can't even show any emotional struggle or turmoil because he's so detached from everything around him. I will say that as the story progresses, the author starts to develop the mystery of Dokja's past and forces him into some interesting situations. So there's definitely room for his character to grow in the future. Enjoyment: 7/10 The pacing is kinda slow, especially in the first 40-ish chapters. But trust me, it's worth the journey. This is the kind of story that teases future characters and events multiple arcs ahead of time, and it's clear the author planned it out pretty well. I'm excited to see where the story goes next. I did NOT expect Ominiscient Reader to be so deeply inspired by Eastern Asian culture and history. There's one arc that's completely dedicated to important figures from Korean religion and history. As a born-and-bred American I'd be hopelessly lost between all the cultural and historical references in ORV if it wasn't for the handy footnotes made by the translators. Overall: 7/10 At the end of the day, Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint kind of feels like a fancy self insert fic. Everyone's always wondered what it would be like to enter the world of a story at the beginning when you already know the ending, right? And you'd think about how you could change the story and take advantage of what happens? That's basically what happens to Dokja in ORV. It's definitely a fun concept, but as a story it quickly gets bland with a protagonist who's too perfect to be interesting. But while ORV might seem a little bland conceptually, it's seasoned with glorious art, great characters, a deep lore, and a healthy dose of wit. Because of that, it's actually pretty fun to read and I would definitely recommend giving it a try."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Damn, like what can I really say about this series at this point. reading Omniscient Reader is like a magic trick. At the start, you are a confused audience member who is staring at awe as something that shouldn't be possible. As the story/act progresses, information is given in small crumbs until the whole magic trick unravels. Once you finish the book, you see the whole trick, but you can't recall how it's done after a while. When you reread, you see all the plants for the trick and it begins to click in your head, and you begin to recollect more and more as the magic ... goes on. You catch the foreshadowing sprinkled throughout the manhwa. For the information that passed right over your head on first read through, you now see the crucial importance of it all and understand the actions and decisions of certain characters more. Whilst knowing how the trick is done, you are enjoying watching the magician do it. You lose no enjoyment just because you know how it works, and you're still entertained to see it unravel slowly. By the end of my second read through, I'm left with one question: how tf do you even pull off a story like this? story 10/10 I imagine the authors when writing this were like.....hmmm I like this aspect of this story, but wouldn't it be cool if there was a character with this ability as well? Oh sh*t, I also wanna add a little bit of time travel cause that stuff’s spicy. Damn, but I really like Greek Mythology, but also Korean Mythology. We definitely need to add like stars and universes and celestial beings and all that jazz. For that matter, I like twitch streams and video games too. What about like monsters and floating fairy demons that look like furry pacman ghosts with horns and stuff? F*ck it, we're using EVERYTHING (I mean literally everything) and we're gonna make it work .....And it works. Art 10/10 - Some panels had me gawking at how beautifully drawn they were. The art is always top tier, but in these most recent chapters, they've somehow become even better. I feel like I could screenshot any panel and use it as my wallpaper. Characters 11/10 - I didn't expect the main character, Dokja, to be so...interesting? During the introduction of his character, you think he's your typical loser loner weeb, who reads web novels all day, and he is! but he's also...not? As the events of the story begin to unfold and the web novel Dokja has been reading for the past 10 years becomes a reality and Dokja does a 180. He becomes cold, calculating, scheming, and sometimes I question whether I should even be rooting for him (at least in the beginning chapters). Also the character development and backstories we get on Dokja are genuinely shocking and add a lot of depth to his character. And it's not just him. Yu Junghyeok, the protagonist of the novel Dokja was reading, is also a fascinating character who gets a lot of development. I won't go much into his character since I don't want to spoil anything, but just know that his dynamic with Dokja had my eyes glued to the page, consuming each chapter like popcorn. And it's not just the main characters! Even the side characters play a large role in the actual story and are genuinely well written and complex. Characters that you don't even think are essential to the story get care and time provided to flush out their inner workings, flaws, strengths, and ideals. Enjoyment 11/10 This series had my brain in a knot and my eyes glued to the page throughout all 550 chapters of the novel as well as the chapters of the manhwa that are released weekly (currently there are about 109 chapters of the manhwa). Every week I'm excited to read the next chapter and to see how the novel is adapted since the novel is by far one of my all time favorites. I hope this series will get the appreciation and love it deserves and I hope that you will also have as much of a blast as I did while reading it! I recommend starting with the manhwa and then switching over to the novel if you are hooked (that's what I did). The start is good, but the arcs only keep getting better and better as the series goes on until you reach masterpiece level. Have fun reading!"}, {"score": "10", "content": "I'll try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible. Conclusion will be at the bottom. After going through _Tower of God_ and _Solo Leveling_, I was looking for more of that good webtoon reading. Looking for similar things, I managed to find myself reading this (this is also one of the first series where I joined up pretty early). And boy, am I glad I did so. This series has had my attention for so long, and for good reason. This series is amazing in the fact that it engrossed me so fast, and still captivates me to this day (currently at chapter 109). It's ... an extremely fun read, and something I read as soon as it's up. What started off as a strong series managed to turn into something truly amazing. As I continued reading weekly, my score for this series slowly went up and up. It's so good that when anyone I know gets into the webtoon world, it's always the first thing I recommend. Honestly, I'm surprised that there hasn't been a review for this, so I decided I'd write one if it got even one person to read this series. Story: The story revolves around the character Dokja Kim, who finds himself reading his favorite web novel _Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse_ (and seemingly the only one left doing so). One day, the web novel ends, and the author thanks Dokja Kim by sending him a gift (a copy of the web novel) and letting him know that his series will become paid content at 7 PM. At 7 PM, Dokja's favorite series comes to life and becomes his new reality. He's thrust into this new reality headfirst along with his work colleague Sangah Yu with the goal of completing the scenarios that are given by the Dokkaebi that appears. These scenarios are streamed to constellations who can sponsor people with coins and gifts to help them progress through the scenarios. Later on, he finds out that not only has his reality changed, he also finds out that the main character of the web novel Yoo Joonghyuk is also there. Yoo Joonghyuk is what you would call a regressor, as in when they die they regress back to the start. Knowing this, Dokja must also keep Yoo Joonghyuk alive as if he is killed, the world could potentially restart and Dokja may not be in it. With the main goal of surviving the scenarios, Dokja continues on living in this new reality of his. Using his knowledge of the web novel, Dokja finds the best ways to go through the scenarios and manipulate them to the way he wants so he can get the ending that he wants. There is also a skill system in which everyone has their own skills, which can be upgraded by using coins and other means. They are also given their own special attributes. Individuals can also be given specific skills from constellations that can sponsor them. They can also use items that can benefit them such as consumables and weapons. Characters: The characters in _Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint_ are just fantastic. They're all pretty well developed, and (so far) no annoying characters whatsoever. It's always nice to see even side characters get some great development and seem interesting. I'll talk about a few of the characters in the series briefly since I don't want to give away too much. Dokja Kim is the main character of this series. He's a friendly individual, but if it comes to it he can be cold as well. He uses his knowledge of the web novel to help him survive the scenarios. This knowledge is used in interesting ways and keeps the series fresh in my opinion. Yoo Joonghyuk is one of the main characters of this series. He was the main character of _Three Ways To Survive the Apocalypse_ and is currently in Dokja's world. He is a cold-hearted character who is hell-bent on getting through the scenarios. Sangah Yu is also one of the main characters of this series. She was Dokja's work colleague. She is an empathetic character with the capability to get things done if needed. Art: This series has some insanely good art. In my opinion, it even has some of the best art in the webtoon world (from the webtoons I've read so far). Every scene just looks fantastic, and well colored (still surprised at how some series are full color and drawn so well). The art continually gets better as the series goes on (not that it was bad at first) and sometimes the scenes stun me with how awesome they look. Conclusion: Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint is, in my opinion, a must-read. It's a story that's well written, has a fantastic cast of characters with great development, art that is just stunning at times, some good world building, a cool skill system, a journey that just keeps on giving, and most of all it's fun. The time invested in this series won't be wasted. It stands out in the medium as one of the greats. Whenever I think it can't get better, it makes sure to let me know that I was wrong. It's one of my personal favorites, and hopefully it'll be one of yours."}, {"score": "9", "content": "This series is a gem, and I hope it sees the success Tower of God did. I am writing this revie was someone who reas the comic first and is only now reading the book (chapter 11) Story: 10. I hate isekai. Especially modern isekai. It’s always some power trip self insert with barley any actual thought going into the characters, especially the main characters, or a good plot in general. ORV has surprised me with how well thought out and planned it is. First, it‘s a trope in Isekai that the MC will know everything about the world as they are a huge nerd. ... Dokja is no exception, the difference here is as he’s been reading the novel he transported into for 10 years, things are hazy, and he will forget things. This is already a nice touch. The story is incredibly engaging and intriguing. Character interactions are fun, exciting and you look forward to them. The characters do not always end up on top, and they are not invincible. In fact, most of the time, Dokja barley gets out by the hair of his neck after saving his team. I have no complaints as of now. This might change. Art: 8/10. The art is simple, but very good. The artist makes a fantastic use of angles and dynamic posing I would just stare at my screen in admiration for a good five minutes at times. As a majority of the characters have the same hair and eye color, unique character designs are extremely important. I think the artist did good with this. There’s no same faces, you could tell who’s who if you switched out the hair and eye colors. The expressions are also amazing. Especially Dokja’s when he’s about to do something crazy. Character: 9/10. Where do I start here. Dokja is just incredible. He is such a morally grey character that the word grey doesn’t even suit it. One of the first things that stood out to me was when he realized he could have saved people, and then goes “yeah, I could have, I don’t feel bad about not though”. Wow. He’s a truly engaging protagonist. He’s not just the typical edgy bad boy though, as he cares deeply for the people around him (he won’t admit it, not even to himself, but the way he takes care of Lee makes it obvious) and won’t hesitate to take on a heavy burden in their place. I’ve been told by my friends that this self sacrificial trait gets worse the story goes on, and is treated extremely seriously and not like it’s a good thing- which I cannot even describe how excited I am for. Dokja is smart. Very, very smart. I’m wary of smart characters in media usually, because it takes a clever author to write a clever character without it seeming like an asspull, but the authors of ORV clearly thought out what they are doing. Dokja’s reasonings make sense and you can totally believe this is just a very intelligent man. Another thing I really enjoy is how even if Dokja himself has issues seeing others as real humans due to the nature of the comic and probably some physiological issue (lol), the characters around him still feel like real people. The other main character- Joonghyuk is a great example of this. He doesn’t trust Dokja as far as he can throw him and activity tries to kill him at some point. Yeah, logical reasoning. If I had to live in apocalypse on a loop and some guy that can bypass my powers came waltzing in I’d be wary too. A trope in isekai is how everything revolves around the main character- including other characters. This doesn’t happen here. There’s plenty of people who consider Dokja a mild annoyance in their own plans. When characters are off screen you can imagine they are doing things that we the reader have no clue about, and are not just staring into a wall waiting for Dokja to make an appearance so they can be characters again. Enjoyment: 10/10. All in all, ORV is just fun to read. It’s an enjoyable comic. You never feel truly bored because even if a big fight isn’t happening, the characters themselves are so intriguing that the time spent with them is just as engaging. I recommend this fully, and I imagine in a year or twos time the recommendations will just keep on rolling in."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Omniscient Reader and i still can't spell the name right lol jokes aside, people liked this and hated on solo leveling even tho both are coming from the same studio? time to do a crusade hah....

Characters: 11/10 It is a character driven story. It excells in its characters. The side characters play an important role in the story. Yeah! The story may not progress well without the characters. Each character has their own unique and realistic backstory. Their development is top-notch. World building: 9/10 It is the only part it is lacking a bit ”for now”.

Trying to survive in the world of omniscient reader's viewpoint is like trying to play dark souls without dying on your first playthrough, so mc has a pretty big advantage from knowing how most of the scenarios will unfold.

Most of the side characters and the mc are pretty bland but that is usually the case with most manhwa. 100% action and 0% romance 9/10 :)"}, {"score": "9", "content": "As someone who has read the novel, I can promise new readers looking for a good story, good character development, and good world building - this is its webtoon. I warn you, this story has a slow pace, since there are so many details that cannot be wasted in the adaptation of the webtoon, so it depends if you like the slow pace, since for me it is good since there are many details that help us to understand many things in the future, we will have. Let's start with the review of the webtoon, not the novel. I'll focus on what the webtoon has adapted, ... which is 59 chapters, well let's get started. Story 8: The story of the omniscient reader is very good In these 59 chapters that we have, the story takes our protagonist Kim Dokja who has been reading a web novel all her life called Ways to Survive the Apocalypse She had Readers but as time went by they stopped being interested in the novel and still left it, after reading the 3149 chapters He reaches the end of the novel he feels very sad since his favorite novel ended after a long time reading it, then a message arrives on his phone from the author thanking him for reading his novel and says that soon the story will be monetized, dokja does not understand what the author said at the end, a short time has passed and something is happening on the train that he was dark and something happens that he would never imagine, his novel Ways To Survive becomes reality in his world, and now he is living in his own novel, what will happen to Dokja in the story? Discover that for yourself in the manhwa. Well, first of all the story begins very well, with an interesting concept of how a reverse isekai, but this goes further, I really liked how the story develops as we go through the chapters, each chapter has its touch and that does See the unique story itself, (I remember, there are only 59 chapters of the webtoon not of the novel) so in these 59 chapters, for me it takes an 8 in this part. Art 9: The Art is Too Good, Almost Equal To The Solitary Leveling It has good shading and good backgrounds, also the character designs seem great to me, so for this point the Art takes a 9. Characters: 8 The Characters in these 59 Chapters Are Very Good, Each one has their moment to shine, not like other stories that the secondary ones are useless and only idolize the MC And they do nothing in the whole story, the characters here have their own purpose And I like that a lot, in development, you can say that in these 59 chapters they have a good development is not great, for now, but they have their development as these 59 chapters go by so that is appreciated, at this point my grade is an 8. Enjoyment 9 This is a personal opinion, so for me, I am enjoying the webtoon a lot, it may be that some do not enjoy it because of the slow pace but that is a matter of taste, also for what they like survival in manga / anime / manhwas, You can also enjoy this manhwa as it has a lot of survival element and I especially love that, my rating at this point is a 9. Overall 9 In the end, Conclusion, I like this Webtoon a lot since it has a very interesting and very good story that develops very well with these 59 chapters and some characters that I love, especially for their personality and their actions in the webtoon, at this point My rating is a 9. Take a look, you may like it or not, but I liked it a lot. (Since the novel has 551 this trip will be very long, as someone who has already read it, I can only recommend it since it is one of my favorite novels in general with an excellent story and many other things). Thanks for reading and I hope you read this story that the truth deserves much more support. Bye :3."}, {"score": "8", "content": "To me it was a good experience of a world with RPG aspects. There are many layers that turn it incredible, the first one is the RPG world, that is something that we already have seen in other Manhwas like Solo Leveling, but still very competent. Following the layers, we have the fact that there is people that can surpass this RPG system and revive, being in a loop. But all this is controlled by divinity's beings, that watch the world like in different streams. And, after all this, there's our protagonist, that had read all this in a Novel, and knows everything that's ... going to happen. So with all this, it makes the experience of the manhwa different from other ones. The OP protagonist, isn't OP because he has great powers or is super strong. He's OP because he has knowledge about what's going to happen and try to guide this in his way.

The main characters ANNND side characters are interesting, have realism elements to their personality and character as well as some fantasy elements that blend well and do NOT leave you feeling as though one just got forgotten by the Author or one key point about them was forgotten. Now the main story isn't also like some of these other ... Manhwas that have no established finish line and story end, it's clear this one does if you read into the story for the first 10 chapters or so, WOWW a story that's not mindless and infinite????? Crazy right, I know, but it is long, you have to have a little bit of extra time dedicated to reading it, but the main thing is that each story element is fascinating in it's own right and keeps you wanting more, some less than others, but still fascinating nonetheless. One thing you must keep in mind is the story has Korean culture, cultural sentiments in their current political atmosphere, and cultural history implemented withing its story, but it also has elements from other cultures as well, it may disrespect a little bit, certain cultures and religions, and mythologies, but for the most part either respects them and/or implements them within the story and its lore. In my opinion it does it good and not to wild to turn me off of any story element, but it can get a little bit spicy at times. Highly recommend it to the anime/manga community, even to the forever Isekai haters that hate Isekai and anything related to it, this does have a piece of that ingrained within it, yeah, I'd rather tell you the truth on that then pussy foot and tap dance around that truth, but I believe this story doesn't do much if at all anything that Isekai's generically do, it has some fanservice, but nothing too crazy and doesn't affect the story. It doesn't have the issue with the main character going through everything with little to no struggle, in fact I believe that's the theme or one of the themes of the story is the struggle to reach the finish line, the sacrifice, the decisions being made, the consequences of certain discissions being made, in fact character's decisions, whomever it may be do not go unpunished, that's another big theme in this story, the high stakes, the constant pressure, AAAND EVEN THE BEST CHOICE IF THERE'S ONE TO BE MADE, can have its consequences and punish the main cast in some way. Great story, great art by the way, it may not be for everyone but I personally LOOOVVVEE the way this artist draws the characters and environment for the most part.

I don't want to go into the nitty gritty of that manhwa because this review isn't served for that. I began reading this with the mental note that this could potentially be on that same route of solo leveling, but I was CLEARLY wrong. Yes, it does have some elements that align with solo leveling such as the attributes system, the fighting of demons, etc, but the story is what I enjoy the most from this manhwa. Kim Dokja at first ... doesn't serve as your normal protagonist. He ends up being enveloped into a novel-esque world based upon the book \"3 ways to survive a ruined world\". His knowledge of this novel allows him to traverse through the never-ending scenarios that are struck upon the characters. However, there is an ACTUAL protagonist aside from the main character that we see. Although Kim Dokja is not the protagonist of the \"story\", he slowly makes his way up to being immersed into being a protagonist. The supposed side characters all have their own unique attributes in relation to their constellations. I'm actually very fond of how they didn't power creep Kim Dokja and make him too invincible to surpass his peers, but instead, gave them reliable skills to fight alongside him. The story itself is mesmerizing. And I can't deny that every good story does derive their ideas from other novels, because no matter what, as the world progresses, stories also mesh together and get influenced by other stories. Although this manhwa uses good ideas from other novels, it also has their own sense of originality, allowing it to live independently on its own. I'm giving this a 9/10 because it deserves high praise and I hope others can enjoy how this manhwa inevitably ends.

Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint (or ORV) is about an underdog hero who had faithfully and loyally read a webnovel to its conclusion. You can say he's dedicated, since he turned out to be the ONLY reader after 3,149 chapters. It's easy to see why ORV is so appealing. It's your typical... I guess \"hybrid\" isekai where the world manages to turn into a video game. It has fresh and interesting ideas, blending in RPGs with a worldwide battle-royale streamed to the... stars in the sky. But not only does the world-building fail ... to captivate me, I just found the story to be oh so very DRY. I dropped this webtoon at chapter 21. I think I gave it a fair enough shot. At the very least, I expected a functional game because well... I'm a GAMER. As sexually repre- cringe as that sounds, do I really need to explain myself? Do you not understand the significance of my undoctored photo of Marianne smiling? Hmph. Casual. Even though my expectations are bare minimal when consuming media, ORV manages to be even worse than my baseline expectations. Not only does it fail to prove that it's a game, it abuses the creativity of game mechanics solely to drive the plot forward - a catastrophic and fatalistic flaw. Where do I even begin with this mess? Well, let's just start from the little details. Whatever the hell this \"game\" is called, it appears to be an RPG from the onset. You have stats and skills to complete your objective. You even have traits, which allow for a \"General Evaluation\" of the character. What's repulsive is that all of the things I've mentioned are more labels than anything. While that IS what they are in typical RPGs, the way ORV uses them is to merely assess a person's capabilities and personality. But you don't need to be a GAMER to tell that the edgy teenager has the \"Edgy Teenager\" trait, or that the Reader can read text faster. It's this uninspired creativity that makes me think that \"Press F to pay respects\" had more meaning than this. Okay, but what about something tangible ORV has? You mean the \"regressors\"? They just seem like the same archetype as \"Edgy Teenager\". You can't tell me that \"Regressors\" have a special meaning behind them because they don't. They're innately edgy because they look like they've seen some shit. And those Dokkaebis? Seems like a cop-out that act like tangible beings for the CONSTELLATIONS to watch via twitch.tv. Bleh, the Constellations. They're these beings that sponsor your journey to beating whatever game this is. Through a dialogue box, you can basically surmise what they're thinking and that their donation of a paultry 100 coins is enough to say they like what you're doing. Ugh, these dialog boxes are my biggest gripe with this webtoon. They tell the reader (both Dokja AND you) EXACTLY what they need to know. But these boxes are EVERYWHERE and explain SO much that you don't even need to think about what's going on. Oh, slap a kid? You'll get 5 dialog boxes from different constellations that basically tell you whether or not they approve of your action (they don't). It feels... too convenient. Almost as if the author is using game mechanics for sheer convenience... But hold on Mr. Chips901, if you were actually IN a game, you'd actually want that kind of information to drive your decision-making. And you'd be correct, wayward reader. But this convenient information doesn't stop at what the gods think of you, the convenience extends to EVERYTHING. From the skills to the traits, all of it is just too convenient and the writing is to blame here. Yes, I'm saying the writing is trash. Because in the first \"game,\" Dokja SUDDENLY becomes super OP and is already well beyond our mortal comprehension. I mean, he literally has a skill called \"FOURTH WALL\" without any description to its abilities or capabilities. Holy shit, the authors are BRAZENLY going for the WOW and SHOCK factors! You'll never know what THE FOURTH WALL is fully capable of, but it can negate you from fear, block people from spying on you, and can even do your final exams for you so that you don't flunk high school. Neat! Now, if it could do my taxes and date my women for me, only then would I consider it \"overpowered.\" The point is, this shitty facade of a game won't work on me. The story bombards you with window dressing words to tell you that Dokja's playing the game right. But do YOU know what's going on? The answer is no. If you did, you'd be able to explain the significance of everything exactly BECAUSE it's a game. The failure to prove otherwise means that the game... isn't really a game. Okay, let's move on to the lack of foreshadowing. Every situation/conflict/obstacle that the characters face are all so predictably boring. Instead of using what you have in the environment to formulate a solution, which would showcase the writer's creativity, ORV almost always elects to tell the reader that Dokja had it all figured out all along. All of this is presented in the SAME moment that the problem is being solved instead of showing the character doing ominous things for the future. It's exactly like you inviting me to a hardware store to assassinate me. And instead of using the wealth of tools at your disposal, be it a hammer or screwdriver, you instead call in an ICBM missile to blow up not just me, but the entire hardware store solely because you want to look cool. +++++S T Y L E. Isn't it obvious that this webtoon isn't for me? This is a story that doesn't need you to think about anything, really. The story lays itself out, from how characters feel to the most overly convoluted solutions for convenience's sake. If you don't like substance in your anime because it simply hurts to think about it, you'll enjoy this story just fine. But even if this webtoon \"gets good\" much later, I just don't see a point to it when I'm being spoon-fed everything from character expressions to THE PLOT TWISTS. What's the point of the journey if you know where you're going? There is none. Curiosity is what drives your passion and reasoning. The lack thereof proves that the journey isn't a meaningful one. In other words, I find ORV completely tasteless because there's nothing to be curious about. Its ideas are great ones, but it can't manifest itself into something much greater. If ORV had something going for it, then I would have already found out within the 21 chapters that I read. And if you still think that I'm missing the point, then please enlighten me. If you can prove that ORV had something worth reading about, then I shall continue reading and change the rating accordingly. \"A Reader should fight like a reader.\" - Chapter 21. This is where I gave up. Everything about this statement shows just how unfortunately shallow this webtoon is. Go ahead, go outside and announce to the world that ORV is the next greatest thing since Sex 2. I'll just go play a REAL video game like Hades instead. Just be back before dinner, mkay?"}]}
{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/121496/Solo_Leveling", "reviews": [{"score": "4", "content": "Solo Leveling has been entitled by many fans as something exceptional–”not like the other manhwas,” or “not like your other power fantasies.” Although I commend them for the awareness of the type of content consumed within the medium–a nod to the saturation of formulaic projects–they ultimately misrepresent what Solo Leveling is. Because, make no mistake: this is your typical power fantasy–a blueprint of one, only adorned with the silk of high production value. Solo Leveling is not necessarily a masterpiece, it’s just simply good at what it does. Despite what I would consider mediocre character writing and world-building, the series never really sells itself as more ... than a power fantasy. While I do believe that the overall story is poorly written, the lack of nuance in its story is also its strength, only delivering exactly what its audience wants: a clean, visually stunning power trip, free of pretense. Jin-Woo has a front-loaded development. Only early on can you find a well-paced, even engaging climb from weak to powerful. However, once he got a hold of how the system works, the fights become increasingly one-sided. No more questioning if he’ll win, thereby failing to keep readers at the edge of their seats. Still, the story deserves credit for decently escalating the stakes. The scale of conflicts moves past minimal threats as global consequences are introduced–keeping the story from stagnating, regardless if Jin-Woo’s win remains foreseen. For all the narrative flaws, what truly carries Solo Leveling, and likely what pushed its success, is the art. Visually, the manhwa is above every other project. Fight scenes are fluid and dramatic, colors are vivid and striking, and the artist’s scale and perspective evokes an epic quality–for lack of a better term–in each and every panel. Jang Sung-rak, the artist, had one job and absolutely killed it. However, for all its highs, Solo Leveling still lacks in many areas. At its core, this story is about Sung, Jin-Woo, an underdog turned unstoppable god. That’s not inherently a problem; the issue is that Solo Leveling past the first few chapters lacks tension, risk, and emotional weight. You are never in doubt that Jin-woo would always win, and I guess that’s the point behind every power fantasy. He suffers no real losses, overcomes every challenge with ease, and his enemies only exist solely for him to overpower. The outcome of every battle is evident from the start–there is no “if,” only “how fast.” There exists an inverse relationship between Jin-Woo’s growth in power and how compelling he is as a character, exhibiting vulnerability and emotional grounding before his reawakening and in a few moments afterward. But with each level-up, his personality fades. Don’t confuse this with the plot’s intention to make Jin-Woo lose certain emotions; he genuinely becomes a duller version of himself in exchange for aura points. What remains is an uncompelling character meant more for projection rather than reflection. Look further from our protagonist, every character has the same amount of nuance–or lack thereof, each only playing a part in helping Jin-woo show how big his dick is rather than challenging him. Allies exist to admire him; enemies exist to fall before him. Even S-ranked hunters–figures who should carry their own gravitas–are ultimately sidelined in favor of Jin-Woo and his shadows. By the final battle, every major moment belongs to him alone—everyone else is simply irrelevant, or worse, a liability. Among the sea of one-dimensional figures, only a few can be considered passable and offer a semblance of emotional grounding. The only decent side characters are his family who treats him as a brother or son, and Lee, Joo-Hee, a potential love interest who sees past Jin-Woo's identity as a hunter only for her to be forgotten halfway through the story. Each character, fight, and narrative turning point exists only to elevate Jin-Woo. The story offers no complexity–only a setting crafted for our protagonist to thrive on. But to its credit, that’s all you ever really need for a power fantasy. Ultimately, Solo Leveling is anything but unique. It doesn’t push the medium forward or challenge the genre’s status quo, but it understands its appeal and wears it with confidence. Despite its shallow story, it’s clean, coherent, and tailor-made to satisfy anyone looking for a turn off your brain, visually stunning power fantasy."}, {"score": "10", "content": "This isn't your typical \"MC becomes crazy OP\" story where the OP MC becomes absolutely boring af. This story is a fucking masterpiece. You may be skeptical about reading it, perhaps you think it will end up trash like many generic RPG/MMO style anime/manga. I assure you that that opinion is completely wrong. The Story: 10/10 Absolutely solid, it flows extremely well and is probably one of the best adaptions of a LN into a Manhwa I've ever seen. The story is filled with plots that make sense, flowing with extremely well written character development, assisted by very good character interactions. Of course, like many stories, it starts out slow. When I ... first started reading this story definitely pissed me off to the point that I was like \"Does this even get better.\" Yes, yes it does. You may be annoyed with the MC and many supporting characters in the beginning but that quickly changes as the character begins to go through a change no one in this fantasy world has experienced before. He is able to level up his rank. Through that experience he drastically changes in personality and is able to experience much more action than previously before, at the bottom of the barrel. This manhwa quickly becomes exciting to read and you'll continuously be asking for more after finishing each chapter. Give it a chance and run through the chapters, I'm sure it's something all action and fantasy lovers will enjoy. Art: 10/10 It's really hard to not love the art style honestly, it's beautiful and clear, well drawn, and definitely adds to the appeal of reading this. Character: 10/10 I cannot get enough of how amazing each character is in their own way. This being a fantasy, theres a loott of things we can't relate to in this story, but even with that the characters are easy to understand, or relate to. The choices each characters make make complete sense based on our understanding of their personality, or their history. We aren't stuck with any characters that have overly unrealistic personalities, which makes reading this all the better. Enjoyment: 10/10 I have reread all the chapters available many times and it really doesn't get old. You definitely may not see this as a Masterpiece like I do, but it is definitely a minimum of a 7/10. If you love fantasy... action... adventure.. then this is for you. Give it a chance and run through all the chapters available, I'm sure you will see the beauty in it. Overall, I give these 86 chapters currently available to us a 10/10."}, {"score": "3", "content": "Every. Damn. Time. I don't understand why this superficial manhwa is so hyped Solo Leveling tells the story of a mary sue named Sung Jin-Woo who tries to mimic a random isekai plot in search of a hollow character development, it's a kpop version of the Arifureta, but Arifureta can be funny for involuntary moments, but here, the things are they're stupids in a raw way, it's the kind of manga a person would make just to satisfy fetish self insert of a cool edgy guy in another world. This story has a terrible worldbuilding, I thought it would show you at the beginning of your journey how ... the world works, but it did not this it at some point (even later), just leaves it to the reader to understand in such a flawed way, and when it suits, it's done in an expository way over and over, it's just \"only talk, dont show'', it doesn't fully justify how the world occurs or at least sets a time for readers to be more immersed in him, that's the proof. How lazy you have to be to make a story. The protagonist is the most uninteresting being here, I imagined that in the first chapter there would be a construction of all your motivation, but then it ends up being foul so you don't care anymore. He thinks he has been betrayed, as people worry about their lives, they are afraid, they have a family to come back to, but no, he needs to contradict himself later with stupid thoughts, the same one who decided that someone else should flee. And when we have a development, everything about it is simply empty, there is no consequence (maybe one, but not enough) to his life, he is a wind head, who only uses a self head when in a dungeon, and only the the most predictable answers at all times, in fact all this adventure is predictable without guaranteeing a moment of real distress or difficulty for the reader. The narrative is lazy, bad and highly expository in the action scenes, as I had said: monologues that only focus when the MC is in the dungeon, we never see that anymore, the dialogues are horrible, I seem to be reading a story where each the characters is deaf and needs to repeat the same thing all the time, when he doesn't, have it, the whole dialogues are empty that don't complement much on the journey, and the author has the audacity to insert a totally random Nietzsche text, that doesn't fit the situation was only played because the author thinks the phrase is cool, and many people consider it deep. The characters are all bad that we can sum up in 2 words: uninteresting and unimportant, I think only 2 characters I could care about, one of them is dead because they performed properly, and their last scene was a moment of construction, the another was only shown in different environments, I doubt the author will use it again, the antagonists are bad, only 1 of them has a plausible motivation, the rest is just bad for being purely bad, the author only knows to do this idea because he needs to satisfy The fetish of seeing a cool edgy guy killing someone. Not even the flashback moments here work for anything, it's always something expositive, and the only thing shown is the first dungeon the protagonist had, basically every conflict for MC, they insert this flashback, jesus this manga not only be without creativity but disrespectful to the reader himself, insisting on something we already understand, because this universe is so empty that he at least has no courage to show anything else, not even a memorable memory at least as interesting as possible, not even his mother dear, who is informed in the first chapter, which has become a lousy excuse for you (the reader) to care about him at the first point and then forget about her, seriously how badly written this it and often lazy again. The development of the protagonist in the general context is acceptable, but scumbag and continuing with shallow labels, I have never hoped for a comic moment to appear in the midst of such a tense scene. I currently arrived midway through the work, the protagonist does not show an interesting image, he is totally one-dimensional that not even his relationships with secondary characters strengthen him, not even in a \"melancholy or mental\" situation the author can humanize the character, he repeats the same flashbacks, give the impression that this is not a story of someone who fights for the people around them, but of someone who needs to satisfy the faster leveling fetish, he seems more like a character for fujoshi to fall in love with because he's so hot and uhh so much badass. The most positive thing I leave is cap55, the first chapter that made me laugh without being stupid about this narrative, but it's still a bad and foul story. And I don't think that can change enough, even if he does, his first part has rotted just like the protagonist's will, it's just an amateur story that doesn't even show courage in his actions, I feel like I'm seeing a bootleg of a Izumi Shinichi just repetitive, I wanted to talk more about this journey, but this empty story keeps me, that's why i don't classify this Manhwa as a good thing, and I don't think I'm just the only person thinking differently."}, {"score": "2", "content": "\"Solo Leveling\", what seemed like an underdog story has really left me disappointed. At first glance, the whole reason I started was to expect him to grow as a character slowly and PROVE himself. However, this is not what I got at all. Forget the underdog story, forget the meaningful process of character growth and development, the story tries it's hardest to make the character look like he's \"struggling\", but it's pretty difficult when the MC has the same emotionless, edgy facial expression on every panel. It's just extremely confusing and frustrating how this supposed \"underdog\" MC gets so strong so damn fast. He is literally flawless, ... he feels completely void of humor and emotion and is just a living, breathing, OP, issekai MC. These 3 paragraphs alone are all about my number 1 reason as to why I dislike this Manhwa so much. The main character just really sucks. The only thing that doesn't give this a \"1\" for me is the art. Absolutely amazing art that made me stomach through the horrible MC writing and directionless plot that could've been finished if the MC just didn't hide his power. The art was literally eye-candy, filled with clean line-work, shading and colours. Anyways, if you don't like edgy, power-fantasy MCs, don't read this. If you were expecting the slow-climb and rise of an underdog, go read \"Hardcore Leveling Warrior\" (technically a \"re-rising\" here), or read Tales of Demons and Gods instead. The MC might be OP in HCLW and ToDaG, but they have limitations and a bunch of situations where they can't just \"clean up\" the enemy as easy as Sung Jin-woo. 2/10"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Solo leveling is a super fun read, where the MC is pretty much op but it never ceases to be entertaining.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS! Solo Leveling is a manhwa that always baffles me whenever I hear someone talk about it. They usually like to say nice sounding buzzwords whenever they praise it, but never bother to actually expand on it. It's always at the front page of whatever site or app you're using. But when I myself read it, it felt like I was reading a completely different manhwa than the one everyone was talking about. Let me break down the different aspects of the manhwa: Art 8/10: Art is the one and only aspect I can praise Solo Leveling for. It's undeniable that it ... has fantastic art and I believe this is the second biggest factor for Solo Leveling's popularity (I'll get to the biggest factor later on). The shading and coloring is fantastic. The reason I have art at 8/10 instead of higher is because of the lack of details and background. Story 3/10: Story...What story? The premise is that gates have appeared around the world with different levels of dangers within them. So they employ hunters to go into the gates and dispose of the danger within. We follow Sung Jin-Woo, a low ranking hunter who suddenly gains a power that allows him to grow stronger through quests and he quickly becomes a S-Rank hunter. I'm gonna be honest, the first like 15 chapters were actually entertaining. And I thought it was gonna turn out to be a really good manhwa. The gate we entered in the prologue was so different than how they are presented in the rest of the manhwa. There were rules to be followed and if not followed it would mean death. This is not at all present in later gates, in later gates its basically just different monsters in different environments. Which means the gates themselves are not at all interesting after the prologue which is a shame cause you had this sense of dread and mystique surrounding the gate when they entered it for the first time. Now I've only really touched on the prologue and gates. So how does the story develop after the prologue? Well...It doesn't really. We simply follow Sung Jin-Woo as he goes into different gates and strengthen himself at an insane speed. It just uses the same formula over and over again. He goes into a gate, something unexpected happens, for instance the gate was more dangerous than it seemed. He handles it with ease despite the difficulty change. And then rinse and repeat. It was very disappointing to have him become so extremely strong so quickly. There was no real sense of progress. One second he's the weakest and another second there is literally no threat in existence that can phase him. Also a lack of overarching story makes it hard to be motivated to continue. There's no real goal Sung Jin-Woo set for himself. They did slightly touch on his mother being ill and he needing to heal her. But they barely explored his relationship with his mother or anything like that. It was more just a dumb reason for him to enter a gate. And it was resolved with ease. Character 1/10: Now we get into the absolute worst part of Solo Leveling. The characters. Mainly Sung Jin-Woo himself. I mentioned earlier about the biggest factor for Solo Leveling's popularity, and this is it. That might sound like a praise, but it's definitely not. Sung Jin-Woo was made to be as bland as humanly possible so that people can insert themselves into him and live out a power fantasy. We barely know anything about Sung Jin-Woo. He doesn't have any real motivation that drives him. He doesn't have any clear morals. In fact, he doesn't really have any emotions at all. Almost every single panel he is in he will make the same generic emotionless edgy expression. He almost never smiles, laughs, look scared, nervous or anything like that. His expression is always like he's watching a mediocre movie cause his girlfriend wanted to see it. He has no development at all either. He goes from being the generic weak main character that's surprisingly brave when the situation calls for it into the generic edgy overpowered main character. There's no transition. And even after he has become overpowered nothing still develops him. And besides, there's nothing to push him into development since the arcs never presents him with a dilemma that forces character change. As for other characters, there aren't really any notable ones. They introduce some new characters each arc but then they just kinda forget about their existence and you never see them again. At this point I've stopped remembering the name of the characters because they've proven time and time again that there's no point to it. I also have a problem with how much they're pandering and using certain characters (mainly female characters) as tools for this. What I mean by this is that Sung Jin-Woo is made to be the ultimate edgy overpowered main character that you can self insert yourself into for a power fantasy. And they also uses characters as a tool to reinforce this, like him needing to rescue every female character as soon as they are about to get hurt (all the while the male characters gets slaughtered left and right). Pretty much every female character he meets will at some point be rescued by him and/or fall for him. For instance there is one female character that is a bit obsessed with him cause he \"smells\" different than other people. And at another point where he's murdering monsters suddenly the last monster surrenders out of fear. And what do you know, that monster turns out to be a super hot monster babe that falls for him. All characters are just tools used to put Sung Jin-Woo himself up on a pedestal or as a measuring stick to see how overpowered he is. Enjoyment 3/10: As you may already have figured out, my enjoyment for this manhwa is not really high. None of the characters are memorable, the arcs are uninspired and had no real purpose except to make the main character stronger. The main character himself was dull. Except early on in the story where it was actually interesting and he had emotions and there was a sense of overall dread. Overall 3/10: I really can't give this any higher. Remove the art which is its only praiseworthy point and all you will be left with is the same generic self insert edgy overpowered main character power fantasy that has all the ladies fall for him. There's nothing memorable at all about this manhwa."}, {"score": "4", "content": "This my first time writing review so go easy on me. Solo leveling has great start we have MC that is weakest hunter but still explores dungeons in order to pay medical bills for his sick mother and to help his sister become doctor however after a incident he gains mysterious power that helps him level up his rank and become strongest. So let's start with good points of solo leveling (1).Good start Start of Solo leveling is good like I said earlier story has relatable MC in the beginning but after that it's down hill (2).Art Solo leveling has great art it's fully colored and it's easy to read ... it's clean, plus characters are good looking. Now for what's bad (1).Story After the good start of story solo leveling gets predictable and boring Every time over mc enters dungeon we know that he will defeat the monster and than say his catchphrase \"Arise\" and add that monster to his shadow army this is same process over and over. (2).characters Worst thing about solo leveling is characters,characters of solo leveling are like NPC. They are here for only two reasons either admire the mc or to hate him no in between. Every time new character is introduced they either praise the mc or hate him. New character are disposed after mc's business is finished with them. No character are relevant they only exist to make us feel how great MC is. (3). Main character Main character of story is sung jin-woo, like I said earlier he is relatable in beginning but than after gaining his powers he becomes self insert,Overpowered,emotionless. If I have to describe sung jin-wooin one word that is Korean Kirito. My prediction for this manhwa is that people will know how bad this is in my opinion this series is going age like milk. I would not recommend this series to anyone with good taste in anime and manga. If you like power fantasy than read One punch man. It's sad to see this manhwa is ranked higher than manga like OPM Solo leveling is just a Good looking trash but trash is still trash."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Solo Leveling is the literary equivalent of an 8 year old playing make-believe with plastic toys.

OR IS IT?!) But yeah. There are no stakes, no sense of danger, no meaningful character development, no interesting plot, no original mechanics, no dialogue, no personality, no charisma, no maturity. Instead, there is the most quintessential Korean reincarnation power fantasy where the main character immediately goes from a weak shy underdog boy to a tall, six-packed and undercut, stern, poker-faced ladykiller giga-sigmachad who can kill everything by sneezing at it and only keeps getting more overpowered by the minute. Because of fucking course he does. And this is enabled via a faux VRMMORPG interface because of fucking course it is. This cookie-cutter drivel writes itself on autopilot these days. The momentary but overemphasized weakness the MC exhibits in the first chapter is a mere formality to transform him into a completely different person right afterwards, and the moderately tedious grind that he undergoes for the majority of the comic's first half is just as much of a formality to establish him as the most powerful, all-around-capable being in the universe in the second half. The longer it goes, the less it makes you care because there's no struggle and nothing matters. Ever. Plot points are introduced and— oh hey, a kitty is playing with its tail! How cute! Moving on. As you can guess, Solo Leveling certainly isn't shy of being the most trite thing in existence—quite the opposite: it revels in its own infinitely indulgent tropeyness, it takes pride in being the textbook example of everything that made the genre so boring and predictable over the past ten years and presenting it with the aplomb of reaching the pinnacle of creation. And in doing so, perhaps to its own merit, it outright discards everything that it doesn't want to do. You cannot fail that which you don't bother with, and so what remains is pure shonen battle sakuga with a side of wish fulfillment fluff, with everything else (including everything of literary substance) being decidedly left out. The detailed full-color art serves the goal admirably where it matters, i.e. when characters are striking a pose so that you could marvel at their menacing looks and soak in the edgy atmosphere. As soon as they start moving, however, it becomes a blurry mess where movements are very poorly defined, there's no sense of space, no impact to any strikes—all of which reflects the very nature of the comic perfectly. It has some style and looks great on the surface but is soulless, lazily written, and mediocre by choice. But to give credit where it's due, at least it knows when to end. So long, leveling."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Solo Leveling does everything it tries to do goddamn right. You may think the setting has been done a million times and it's just another generic overpowered main character doing what he wants, it's exactly that, but executed absolutely magnificently in every regard. Story: 10/10 The setting is quite simple, one day gates start appearing all over the world out of nowhere and people start awakening magic abilities in order to close these gates. Our main character is a man dubbed \"The Worlds Weakest Hunter\", Sung Jin-Woo, who joins these raids in order to pay for his comatose mothers treatment and his younger sisters education. After a raid ... gone horribly wrong, Sung Jin-Woo awakens an ability that enables him to level up his abilities, which is unheard of. The story follows Sung Jin-Woo's growth as a person and a hunter. The mystery and high-stakes in this manhwa make it an enticing story to follow. Art: 10/10 This is where Solo Leveling shines above all it's competitors. What starts off as mediocre art suddenly improves drastically to become pure joy to look at, I've never seen manhwa done so beautifully. It's so unique you can't really compare it to art you see from something like OPM for example. Each panel is a sight to behold and truly makes you appreciate it on a whole other level. Keeping in mind it's released on a weekly basis which is unbelievable. Character: 9/10 Unique characters with good character development throughout the series. For most of the series the way they introduce new characters at the right rank milestones for Sung Jin-Woo is executed very well and at multiple times in the series will you go like: Whoah, holy... what a badass character. Enjoyment: 10/10 In every aspect this is a masterpiece to behold and I urge you to give this a fair chance, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. Overall: 10/10 Hands down one of my favorite reads ever, it's captivating and you may find yourself re-reading the series over and over again without even giving it another thought.

Or at the very least the TLDR review, thanks for reading in advance.) This is the story of a man who levelled up all alone. It's hard to write about Solo Leveling whilst accommodating to everyone, which is something I'd like to try to do since the series is both an obscured masterpiece whilst actually still being very good so much so that it doesn't deserve to be overshadowed by some of the hate it gets. To understand why Solo Leveling is a good piece of work we first need to understand the community. It's ... crystal clear to me that two types of individuals exist. The ones who enjoy a bit of hype action regardless of internal plot/story content, and the ones who call out stories for being exactly that. As is Demon Slayer, and probably JJK (hell, might as well be every shounen for that matter), Solo Leveling is no expectation in this case. I wish to be on a point of which I understand where both sides are coming from since to me it is clear that stories like Solo Leveling is literally just trying to be a simple hype piece of work for action lovers, but there are some elements in which makes me believe that this story is just not there in masterpiece status, which I will get to more on later. In actual fact, it is why I can actually side with the latter callout group in this work rather than others simply because of some of the stuff that Solo Leveling does that makes me become unforgiving. At its core, SL is a simple story. That story is levelling up, and levelling up my dude Sung Jin-woo is so damn good at. This \"zero to hero\" story takes its sweet time getting into the actual good parts that make everything about SL so enjoyable, that is, literally just levelling up I suppose. It's a slow game but the payoff is a pleasant one, and for the most part, it is the grind from nothing to god type power that is the core of SL, because that is where the levelling up actually happens. Of course, it isn't a flick of the switch like OPM for example, Sung Jin-woo goes through many experiences calling for a wide variety of tactics, strategies and strengths for him to be the true king of the playing field. Many times you may find yourself thinking as to what Jin-woo will do in X situation. With him being overpowered, it doesn't mean that he is liable to just battle alone, the story does exploit some real-life calamities that need well-thought decision making, a little bit like politics if you like but only specific to the hunters in this story. SL knows this all and plays with such elements in a way that would make you want to praise the story even more. Faults are present here, however, which I will come onto more later. Something else I'd like to touch on here is the themes of such a story. What we have here is not just plot specifics that are respectable and all, but past a transparent layer, you are met with some interesting themes about the absurdity and reality of having such immense strength in a real situation. Sometimes these themes drop off as easily as they come, but the existence of such only gives me a reason to praise the thought anyway, it is just a shame that it was not expanded on, as that would have been quite an interesting way to develop Jin-woo, which it does in a literal sense, but not enough so it has a lasting effect as an actually good and developed idea. The means of being so overpowered would have forcefully changed his life anyway, so to call it something of a developed theme in that sense is missing out on the specifics that actually carry the story to where it goes. Such is just my perspective on the matter, however. Take what you will from it. Or in other words, being overpowered is no simple game. And I like SL's acknowledgement of that for sure. However, SL does fault a lot when getting into \"serious\" and \"mature\" territory as such. When something gets into said grounds, I'd expect it to take itself seriously enough so that the setting can become enjoyable. SL has nothing wrong in that matter, it is serious enough to understand everything and still not raise eyebrows. My issue with it is simple. It is boring. Really. Very. Boring. I know I've just praised the story a whole lot. It is something that makes sense to itself, but it can come across as something of a disorderly author trying to piece together two very different puzzle boards and hope that something good will come out. I am not here trying to say that \"serious\" + action is some inherently bad connection to make or write a story on, I quite liked *most* of Attack on Titan, and I would imagine maybe FMAB would probably fall under the same category (talk about a controversial duo). But SL was literal switch-ups to and from the \"serious\" side with the hype content. It isn't even a theme thing, this is a plot thing to need to get used to. When you are flying well with one side, you then get another almost irrelevant matter on the next. You could argue that in the nature of the webtoon, in order to move forward content, one would need to have this game of catch for it to just be stable. In my eyes at least, that is problematic. It ends up being a binary system only having to wait on when a foretold event comes over another. I'd be more willing to forgive if the—let's just call it SoL—side of things was actually interesting. It is mostly made up of \"we need Jin-woo here!\" or \"who should we send to fight the beasts\" or something trivial like that. I mean, it probably could have gone further and at least made such moments interesting. Unfortunately, I was not met with such whilst reading all unfolding. Oh well. There's another bit of storytelling I need to touch on as well. That part is the lore of SL. Now, truth be told, I don't remember all of it. I don't believe it was interesting enough for me to care about and was something that came across as a copy-paste RPG type thing with all \"monarchs\", \"rulers\", \"god\" and all that rubbish that came out of my ears as fast as they came in. Though, I give respect for it to even include such. Sure, it was a certain and integral part of the story, but in the drawn-out chapters of this webtoon, at least it didn't just say \"ah yeah, those guys existed and now they have beef\". I respect that it is something of detailed lore that whilst not the most enjoyable or interesting there is to offer, was still something anyone could tell has some thinking behind it. Whether you will submerge yourself within the lore is a detail for another day. I won't go too much on the topic too, mainly because it had no real overarching themes plus such info gets given away way later on in the series so I have no real intention to discuss such. Now. Characters. Or the character. This webtoon has a tendency to make everything about Sung Jin-woo. He really does level up alone. I don't exactly have a problem with everything being centred around the dude, and to be fair, that is what I quite like about the webtoon. It is just about him at the end of the day and his journey as the solo leveller. With his strong development from zero to hero, I can only really praise what goes on in the story in relation to him. At one point we are given a time in which we can actually see the change from zero to hero, like a literal side by side comparison. For such a long series, the flashback only makes for such a staggering effect on the mind to absorb into oneself. Seriously very good stuff around Sung Jin-woo. It's a little absurd though, I have no idea if this was intentional or not to in fact embrace the solitary nature of the story, but I will comment nonetheless, and that is the lack of importance of side characters. Everyone who isn't Jin-woo gets minimal treatment to the point in which they could actually be considered background characters, as fast as they come is the period in which they also depart. It is a little disappointing at times since many had the potential to become pivotal characters in the webtoon, but I supposed that such is to be expected from an egocentric story. That isn't to excuse the matter though, since bothering so much about some characters lead to a disappointing memory of their existence. Actual thought out characters like Yoo Jin-ho, Cha Hae-in, Go Gun-hee, members of Jin-woo's family, hell even Radiru Esil should have either been minimal matters, or people you could actually look back and think \"wow, what a great character\". Such of course is not present here, and whilst I do understand that, yes, it may have been a good call in a story of this kind, it still acknowledges that at the end of the day there were some very disappointing characters here. Now, the selling point of SL. The entire reason (I believe) it is so highly praised. That is simply due to the art in the webtoon. Now, I will point out that I don't read a ton of webtoons (as of this review's publication anyway), but I will point out that of all that I've seen in the medium, SL easily topples everything in terms of quality. The only thing coming close is \"The Horizon\" but that has an entirely different story so you need to take the art in a different manner than you would this action, actually \"The Horizon\" may even be better but that is not the point right now and is for another time. But anyway, this webtoon has some seriously good art. Whilst I'd like to believe that SL is just a product that is close to a reflection of the webtoon medium, I have yet to see something as good as itself, so I truly would go out of my way to say, yes, this is some kind of artistic masterpiece. This is like the Demon Slayer equivalent of webtoons. It is that good. What is consistently found is not just a heavily detailed sequence of action and battles, but detail to a point where it is made to become believable to an illusory point of actual motion. It's not just onomatopoeic, it is an edited work to suit such tones consequently enhancing the many clashes that arise in this webtoon. As you have moments of intense action, you are able to fly through them in a way that would make you the camera of the moment. You have your page turns from manga to create effects and such, SL took the webtoon's infinite scrolling as a means to guide the reader down an action-packed path suitable for their imagination, whilst also having enough moments to make for a quick and intense battle as everything is made out to be in the story. It's kinda genius really, but I am not sure whether to consider such as coincidental or intentional, but with panels literally being too large for a perfect fit length (unless you are on 50% zoom or something wild like that), you are met with a forceful scrolling down of actually moving yourself to see the entire picture unfold. You'd have one side and then go down a bit to see the other. You'd have characters at the top of the page in a wide shot, only to cross-hatch down to a close up of how intense the battle was going from up there. I may be making some obscure thoughts here, but I genuinely felt that way when I was reading the webtoon. It is a good way to exploit the endlessness of a webtoon in a way to forcefully make you drag yourself down for what lies ahead. Not that the action isn't enough though, being equally intense and immersive, I should refer back to how the effects here are no joke too. You have tilt shifts and blurs here that do a splendid job at conveying speed and movement relative to the characters and where they are. I should go on about the comic book type format too, which works really well in making for some action as you'd expect from something with the style. Coherent, bombastic enough to not care about meaning, fast enough to not end up lost, there's a long list of things to go on about, some of which I've just forgotten about after reading this for a long while now, but my point stands and even in the early chapters, considering how consistent in quality this is, there was no point in which I feel as if the artwork lacked in some kind of area associated. It's a magnificent action webtoon and something that has its well earned praise with apex level work being a permanent mark in its entirety. Now, to end with, I will go over the enjoyment reasons for SL and give a fair judgement as to why it isn't as bad or good as made out to be. SL's reputation is an easy target for it to be obscured by both aforementioned sides, that is, the lover of visual spectacle, and the seekers of zenith literature. What I see in the community is the lack of acknowledgement from either side to understand the reasonings either side tries to present. Because it is probably the best example, I will use Demon Slayer. As SL, Demon Slayer is a manga that received an anime adaptation that whilst indeed was praised to some absurd (but reasonable) degree, is still something that should be understood as to why it is so loved. Take any \"overrated\" anime/manga, Your Name, Clannad AS, literally any top shounen. Titles which are praised when other *very* similar titles are not praised as such, called out as overrated for some trivial matter like \"the art is the only reason it is good\" or \"it's just boring dramatic cry bait\", to which I say \"so?\". Such takes are obviously very reductionist and don't take the whole criticism into account, but those are usually the foundations. Of course, whilst they are indeed valid opinions anyone could have, it's strange to be someone to disregard something as trivial, in a way that states that it is some kind of objective statement. Why can't clarity be a sophisticated reason as a means to enjoy something? I've seen many works with \"nothing\" to speak of that still manage to land some very high praise from me simply because it was an honest passionate piece of work that managed to understand its audience and simply delivered the highest quality piece of work you could imagine in such a genre. To say Demon Slayer and the likes are bad because there is no \"detailed story\" or \"characters were flat\" is the equivalent for me to take Monster and call that out for being \"too philosophical\" or \"boring for being so serious\". I am not saying to start getting your ideals checked out, you can enjoy what you want, I simply say to understand why it is people like the works as such. SL is a very enjoyable piece of work because of how it is a magnificent action-packed eye-candy full of tirelessly battles that only know how to give more than the last. It is very VERY reasonable as to why it is currently sitting at a score of ~8.8 as of this review. Though, of course, this doesn't help out for people who are actually looking for a well thought out story. When we have one side not acknowledging why people will be quick to point out irrelevant plot issues. The same side lacks awareness for the legit reason of pleasure that comes with an elegant piece of literature. SL happens to be devoid of this. Completely. This is not a problem in a rational sense. Why does everything need to be deep? But, at the very least for SL, is something that I have to agree on, that yes, it becomes a fault—it needs to be considered too. At least with Demon Slayer, it doesn't have all that lore and pseudo politics, at least with Your Name it doesn't try to expand on a simple idea with a simple story. SL tries to go and play a safe game where it should have noticed that said the safe game was a very conflicting element in large in retrospect like I would have ignored this argument if it weren't for that, but the reality of the situation is that there more reasons become apparent whilst criticizing the story of SL in what it actually habitats. It's sad, but hey, that's what we have here. In some collection of thoughts, SL becomes something of a great webtoon to enjoy. It's one with a ton of basic features like good art and hype that sustains it long enough as it has already done so albeit as with action anime/manga—ones with good production behind them. A distortion arises a wall between two very vocal sides who forget the simple needs of the other. With an entirely flashy and fierce presence comes a lackluster story that was indeed good, but faltered as time went on with the abundance of newly found monotonous discussions that seemed to linger for an eternity. At the end of the day, I suppose SL is a game of patience for the fans of action, but seeing the high reception, even those fans seem to be fine with everything here. Otherwise, others who thought they were in for some kind of next FMAB have come to the wrong place, though, there's no harm in wanting a bit of fun here in my opinion. Take what you will from this webtoon, it's not every day something as SL comes, in its own culture of copy-paste RPG type manhwa as you have Japanese fantasy light novels flooding the place. Why not just have a bit of fun? Isn't that why you entered the medium? ---------- TLDR Review: Story - 7: A simple story that expands itself a little too much to the point where it has to consider a lot, effectively making it boring at times due to a lack of interesting moments that consistently find themselves present here. Art - 10: Undoubtedly amazing art. From crazy fights to insane detail that it almost looks like GFX. What is not to like with the additional scrolling mechanism that enhances the experience? Characters - 7: It's all Jin-woo's world. Other characters are kinda disappointing to have a memory about. However, in Jin-woo's solo hold up of the story, his development is pretty cool and likeable. Enjoyment - 8: Very enjoyable for its hype moments and only that. Otherwise, content which aims to show something more \"sophisticated\" is devoid. That's kinda not the point but given how seriously this webtoon takes itself, it can be understood why one would dislike it for such. Still very good tho. ---------- I somehow managed to write a lot on this which was kinda easier than I expected but also had a very low input than I would have imagined, but I consider this review a good write up of mine so I will publish what I have written without any major changes for the sake of haha long review I must be smort :))). But yeah, SL was in some grey area of what it was that made it good and bad that I haven't (explicitly) seen many comments on about. So I thought to give both sides of the argument and well, just say that it was fun, because it really is. To anyone who wants though, I've read a webtoon similar to SL which actually has a more profound and thought-provoking story to it. It goes by the name \"Omniscient Reader\" which is well worth the read if you weren't so much of a fan of this due to a dry story. But whatever. One thing is certain with SL though: This extraordinary story of a man who went from nothing to the most powerful human on earth. That man's name is Sung Jin-woo, how he got to that position was truly a grand event to witness. How did he do it? \"I Level Up Alone\" Overall - 8.0 (8)"}, {"score": "1", "content": "The rampant inflation of scores in MAL's database has really gotten worse over the years. If something this shallow and mediocre was given a generous rating of 8.6, then I wouldn't even be surprised if five or so years later Berserk gets overtaken by some random powerfantasy action isekai. While highly unlikely, you can't deny its possibility, especially with the rapid decline of the animanga community's preferrence in storytelling over the past decade. The lack of maturity and thoughtful critique within the community has only exacerbated this problem, making it increasingly frustrating for those of us seeking more nuanced and honest evaluations. It really goes ... to show that popularity doesn't always equate to overall quality, and this series proves that. Solo Leveling, with how it's constantly lauded with compliments and overwhelming positive reviews from its fanbase, you too would naturally be under the impression that you're in for what seems like an exceptional reading experience. However, that wasn't the case as after reading it myself, I quickly found out that it fell far too short from the \"masterpiece\" its reputation suggests. What you get instead is a narrative structure that prioritizes style over substance, leaving little to no room for readers who value depth, complexity and emotional resonance in a story. Which led me to the conclusion that the overwhelming acclaim seems to have come more from the series' surface-level appeal and the community's personal bias towards escapist powerfantasies rather than any substantive storytelling or meaningful character developments. The use of a progression system as a shortcut for character growth diminishes the value of the protagonist’s journey from weak to strong. Relying on a cheap growth mechanic like the System indicates poor writing and lazy storytelling since the character's growth isn't earned through personal struggle and effort. While the protagonist's initial effort to survive and grow stronger can be viewed as genuine struggle, demonstrating his determination and will to change his circumstances. However, the fact that his power progression is facilitated by a system designed by a higher power (providing carefully curated challenges and rewards) undermines the organic nature of growth. In this context, the effort he puts into fighting and surviving is real, but the framework that ensures his growth is artificial, making it feel cheap. This can be seen as a type of narrative convenience where the struggle is controlled, removing randomness and external risks that typically define true hardship and the unpredictabilities in character development. The supporting cast's lack of any real purpose in the story is incredibly frustrating. Cha Hae-In, positioned as the protagonist's potential love interest, is a prime example. Despite her unique ability to detect the smell of mana and her reputation as a top-ranked S-Rank Hunter, her character arc quickly stagnates after her introduction. Her involvement in the story rarely extends beyond being a bystander to the protagonist’s battles or a vessel for romantic subplots that lack significant development. What could have been a dynamic partnership between two powerful hunters instead feels underutilized, with Cha reduced to admiration from the sidelines rather than active participation in key events. Similarly, figures like Baek Yoon-Ho and Choi Jong-In, introduced as formidable hunters in their own right, serve little narrative purpose beyond emphasizing the protagonist’s growing dominance. Their roles often boil down to offering exposition or reacting in awe to the protagonist's feats, robbing them of any meaningful growth or contribution to the overarching plot. Lastly, the fact that the author didn't capitalize on the opportunity to delve into the topic of the consequences of immense power, which should have been written all over the wall, was such a massive waste of potential. They would rather stroke the protagonist's shlong for the entirety of the series' run than add depth to the narrative, it's ridiculous. But it's fine as long as they make the protagonist look cool and edgy, am I right, kids? HAHA! So, would I recommend Solo Leveling to anybody with standards? Absolutely not, that would be embarassing. But, I definitely would recommend this to people who just want to experience superficial thrills in a story, because despite it's many flaws I can still see why people would like it. Fun is subjective, as much as I didn't enjoy the series, it might not be the same for others. It still sucks balls though 1/10."}, {"score": "2", "content": "Oh no, where do I fucking begin. Despite what many of the manwha legion will claim, this story is not one that is good and has no real meaning that leaves you feeling bored after the official ending. This shit must have been written by an angsty 15 year old because it is every bit of power fantasy that you would expect from a something written by them. The main character has a heroic moment at the beginning, but after that his personality does a complete 180 and is easily one of the most powerful characters nearly 30 chapters in. A lot of stories seem ... to miss the slow progression of the hero and it is very saddening to see a bunch of the hero's development and charm nearly disappear. Before explaining the rest of the story, a fatal flaw about the manwha must be discussed. The simple fact that no other character in the show (except for one other character that is promptly killed) takes all of the interesting progression out of the story. I do not understand why the author thought that it was a good idea to lock everyone else's power level and only have him scale up. Later on, this becomes a massive problem later on, but this is even important near the beginning. The art is pretty good, especially for a webtoon. Panels can be boring and the backgrounds can be lacking. Overall, it's fine and there's nothing that can be too criticized, other than the fact that the character designs can be uninspired. Here comes the issue. Spoilers ahead. The story revolves around leveling up, so it goes without saying that the enemies would need to be more and more powerful over time. Giving the main character a necromancer ability that allows him to use very strong monsters from past fights was a big mistake. It completely removes any weakness that he may have and effectively kills all the tension that may arise in fights. Having the main character lose builds character and increases stakes for later fights, but after so many fights with 0 losses I know that he can't lose. Power creep gets very bad after he clears the hard demon dungeon, and that's when I lost almost all interest. Every other character is sucking his dick and he has near infinite power. His edge is also through the roof as he kills without mercy but is still kind-hearted? I just didn't understand his character. When he single-handedly defeats an enemy that none of the other top hunters in the nation could do combined and rose him from the dead, I understood that the manwha could not go on and that it's problems could only get worse. How could the character even lose at this point? He is unbeatable and untouchable. This is as generic and bland as it gets, saved only by the art. Tl;dr I would avoid this one."}, {"score": "5", "content": "This is average, no more, no less. Story (5/10) It's a simple story and executed in a very average manner. A classic zero to hero and not much more to say about it. There are some plotholes especially in the world building but none of them are really that damaging on thier own though. Art (7/10) The art is good, having it colored makes it way more lively and for the action scenes, which after al are one of the strong points of the manhwa, it does work well. But it's no more than that, good, do not expect beautiful art pieces you can simply sit there ... and admire. The art is streamlined for action, made to be scrolled through quickly. Characters (4/10) The characters are shallow, to feel empathy towards them is hard, borderline impossible in my opinion. They don't feel like people, rather they are spotlights pointed at our MC to amplify his awesomeness. Enjoyment (4/10) It didn't really make me wish to continue reading except on some particular panels in the begining. For me geting to chapter 42 was a grind. Well then, would I recomend this to anybody? If they are unable to accept black and white action scenes yes, otherwise no. The art really does, in my opinion, shoot this manhwa into the stratosphere when it really just wanted to go on the trampoline. I understand some people might've longed for colored action scenes for years but I don't believe this manhwa is the one truly magnificent manhwa that deserves to be praised as the long awaited messiah. Wait a little longer and we might find something truly worth remembering."}, {"score": "4", "content": "Story- 3 The MC is crazy overpowered, and there's absolutely no tension left in the story because of that. There's not a single point past the first 50 chapters of the series where I could at least kind of imagine that he could've died because he NEVER loses. The most he'll get out of a fight is losing a handful of his soldier minions- meaningless when he has a million of them- and maybe a scratch on his cheek- which he can heal with a single thought. The plot is super formulaic. Weak dude suddenly gets blessed with amazing powers and becomes an awesome hero who shows ... up all the lazy corrupt muscleheads who think they're strong. It's just a power fantasy. Art- 8 The story might suck, but the art is amazing. The artist's constant use of glow and blur effects for action scenes really adds to the sleek aesthetic of Solo Leveling. Character- 6 The protagonist, Sung Jin-Woo, had some minor character growth in the first 20 or so chapters but since then he's devolved into an edgy edgelord with zero character depth. (Who happens to be incapable of wearing clothes colored anything BUT midnight black.) He's a Mary Sue through and through. In Solo Leveling, the entire world revolves around this guy. Everyone wants to get close to him and use him, or wants to worship him as their savior, or is scared of his power and wants to kill him. A lot of characters want to do all three. He isn't just a healer or a summoner or a mage- he's every Hunter type *and more.* He's overpowered, infamously famous, dark but not evil, intelligent and never conflicted, perfect in every way... how are we supposed to related to this guy again? The writer even misses out on a key opportunity for giving him character growth. Since he's killed so many people and monsters, and since both people and monsters are shown in the story to be sometimes good and sometimes bad, there's plenty of room for a moral conflict there- should he stop killing everyone so mercilessly and give them a chance to change? Or is he in a kill-or-be-killed world where compassion becomes weakness? The writer completely ignores this opportunity for giving the story some depth and instead goes with a story revolving around our protagonist, a necromancer mage summoner supreme overlord of dark energy and death and flashy attacks, clashing with big angry demons in big fancy smashfests, each one more grand and explosive than the next. No one else besides the MC even gets any development. There are some interestingly conflicted characters who were around at the start of the series, but since then they've been quietly shuffled into the background of the story. By the midpoint of the manhwa, there's little to no character depth in the series at all. [Side rant- The manhwa doesn't even hesitate to take a dump on the one actually well-written scene from the light novel, where we get to see Sung Jin-Woo from the point of view of ordinary citizens, as people react to his fierce battle watching from their TVs at home, as his heroic actions restore an old man's faith in the strength of Hunters. From that scene in the light novel, readers got to see Sung Jin-Woo as not just a monster-slaying warrior, but a symbol of hope for humanity. The manhwa downplays and shortens this whole sequence so much it might as well not have been included.] Enjoyment- 2 Solo Leveling was an immensely disappointing experience for me. The story and characters are flavorless and boring and the writing is downright lazy. All this manhwa has going for it are the action scenes but even flashy fights don't mean anything if they lack all forms of emotional weight and tension. At the end of the day, there's not much I can say I enjoyed about this series. All I can say is that if mindless action is your thing... by all means, give Solo Leveling a shot. But if you're turned off by bad writing and a boring cast of characters, please stay as far away from this series as possible, because it is not worth the read."}, {"score": "2", "content": "Let's start with the positives. Out of all the aspects of Solo Leveling, the art is definitely the best. However, that isn't saying much considering it follows the basic soulless Korean manwha artstyle. Unfortunately, the rest of manwha leaves much to be desired for the reader. The worst part of the manwha is easily the characters. Any character besides Jin-Woo is pointless and simply serves to further the point that Jin-Woo is the strongest character. They are very one-dimensional and hard to get attached to or feel anything for the characters. Jin-Woo is not much better. He is your stereotypical manwha badass that defeats every villain ... and attracts people towards him romantically or platonically. He doesn't have any redeeming qualities besides being a badass that the readers desire to be like. The story is also very uninspiring. It is a very repetitive manwha where Jin-Woo enters a dungeon, clears it, gets an upgrade, and becomes even more overpowered. Besides the beginning where there was at least some struggle, there are very few obstacles for Jin-Woo to overcome as he is way too overpowered to beat. There is no tension and no suspense as everyone knows the outcome. Jin-Woo will beat whatever big antagonist the author throws at him and saves the day. This formula creates a very mediocre story that becomes more and more uninteresting as the story continues. It is just your regular boring power fantasy that serves a specific audience that enjoys reading someone absolutely owns and destroys everything in their path. Overall, Solo Leveling is not this spectacular game-changing manwha that promises something amazing for new readers. It provides the same thing that many other manwha provide. A mindless power fantasy that fails to present anything of real substance to the reader to take away besides the badass MC will win because he is the MC. If that is something you enjoy then that's perfectly fine, but I can't help but feel disappointed after reading."}, {"score": "4", "content": "This Manhwa is only on top manga board because it was doing all the cliche, plot point of all the other shounen, OP main character trope from all the trend Sao, One punch man, Overlord,Moon light sculpture very well and all the new reader who was not feed up or familiar with the older would not understand how much this Manhwa suck dick. This Manhwa is just stalling time bomb, the MC keep getting stronger with little to no risk or stake, and the MC is just a cookie cutter guy with no trait worth noting, it just to make us feel like the ... MC so we can live out the fantasy of getting stronger easily and all the women just wet seeing us for no decent reason. It has biggest problem of shounen battle manga of just keep upping the scale (lazy writing) plus all the character all just foils for the MC and the setting wasnt entirely Inspiring or even felt real at all, like how can the government control all the volatile of power human running around, why haven't power human take control of the world, because Country paid them money to be law abiding citizen? because they will overlook their crime, bitch, the government was clearly demonstrated to not even compare to all the private own Groups? Why the government even allow private group to use the portal for grinding xp and item for levels and money anyway, China would fuck them all to death or nuke the whole country before it allow non regulated group to control them and tip the power scale, so i imagine, US, Korea should do their best to control all the gate and take all the power it can to compete. Like it so stupid to even allow a group to even have the opportunity, the chance to have the even more power than the government, not the people but private own group. Overall Solo leveling is just copying all the trend without adding any unique twist, charm or even character to the genres, it just do all the old thing really well, that why the story is Pathetic, the character is poor but the art is very good lift up the whole Manhwa, the only reason it not getting 9,10 from art is because it's Manhwa, wasting paper POS format plus the design most of the time is only decent. It's still enjoyable cause the formula work but the OP power scaling Formal clearly have Aged A LOT especially if you are as generic as Solo Leveling so i'm not in good conscious give this anymore than a 5."}, {"score": "1", "content": "I wanted to like Solo Leveling. I'm Korean; I genuinely want to see manhwas succeed and stamp their place within the Animanga industry, but I finished reading and regretfully my first and only thought about Solo Leveling, without pulling punches, was that it was utter garbage. It's completely devoid of creativity, it's painfully predictable, the characters all suck (not that anybody other than the MC mattered in the first place), and because of these numerous faults it made for a very boring and unengaging reading experience. When I think of how one could still manage to write an interesting story in which the protagonist is ... dumb overpowered, I look to One Punch Man and how well Murata managed such a difficult task with Saitama. Saitama is untouchable in the OPM world, every reader knows this, we know Saitama can never lose yet OPM is still so special because it does everything else so well. The side cast is excellent, characters like King, Genos, Garou, and others each exhibit their own charm and display a belonging within the story. Of course, whenever Saitama is in action the outcome is an obvious victory for our MC, but this never feels like a problem because we as readers are cognizant of this fact; it's because Saitama's opponent is always presented as the challenger rather than the other way around that makes for such an interesting element, like a Souls game, except in this instance our protagonist is the seemingly impossible boss fight. This is why such a heavy emphasis is placed on the side cast, as One Punch Man is ultimately a story about our stupidly overpowered protagonist in search of his equal, and therefore to make such a thing happen the side characters must be more important than even the main character. On the contrary, Solo Leveling failed to compensate for its overpowered MC in every possible fashion. Sung Jin Woo begins the story in the abyss of powerlessness, just but an ant at the very bottom of the food chain. Jin Woo then receives a massive power-up, as expected from any story like this, and gradually scales his way up the food chain but at a certain point in what was still the infancy stage of the story he gains quick access to completely busted monsters that eventually work under him as slaves. From this point on it really was a cake-walk for Jin Woo, as nobody and nothing stood a chance to him. None of the side characters are worth a single penny within Solo Leveling; all of them are utterly powerless and rendered useless before Jin Woo and it certainly does not help their case when not one of them possesses any traits that make for a good character. Instead of using the side cast to augment and give some more depth to the overall story like any good writer would, the creator of Solo Leveling would rather treat these side characters as throwaways to further increase the gap in power between Jin Woo and everybody else. What is the point of a ranking system when nobody other than Jin Woo is worth a damn? Almost like Naruto and how everything in between Genin and Jonin ultimately meant nothing. The story is disgustingly unoriginal which goes without saying: the typical zero to hero. There is no depth whatsoever, just a linear path without any obstacles from one enemy to the next until we finally arrive at the last one. Whatever type of half-assed effort of world-building was immediately vanquished when Jin Woo went from the strongest hunter in South Korea to immediately the strongest in the world. Just an absolute sh*t show. I'm just not understanding where this Solo Leveling hype stems from. Is it because it's in color and you all view it as a novelty? Or is it because you enjoy a story even an average 3rd grader is capable of writing? I'm not a fan and wouldn't recommend to anyone with any type of standards."}, {"score": "2", "content": "***contains spoilers*** This series is straight-up offensively bad. Normally I wouldn't care and just move on with my life, but from the high ratings, the comparisons to much better series (such as To Your Eternity), and the constant front-page status on various manga sites, I just want to say: shame on the manga/manhwa/webtoon reading community. As others have mentioned, this goes beyond basic wish fulfillment. It manages to be a masturbatory, fetishistic parody of something that was already indulgent to begin with. Characters 1/10: There is only one character that 'matters', that being Sung Jin Woo. Every single other character is window-dressing meant to ... frame SJW in the best light possible, either by being in awe of him or being comically evil/arrogant in order to justify his psychopathic behavior. Manhwa, I have noticed, seems to struggle with restraint. They are not content with merely having the main character stand out, that character must dominate every single aspect of life, and effortlessly rub it in the faces of every other male character. From women to money, to strength, to appearance, to fame, to rare valuables, to potential, and even regarding more intangible ideas like being the most mysterious, or being the most aloof and cool-headed. They are at once designed to be the superficially indulgent male suitor in a harlequin romance novel and OP protagonist of a Wuxia novel. What's more, the edgy nature of these MCs goes beyond simple brooding to appeal to the typical hoodie weeb, it is also *heavily* sexualized. Dangerous yet loyal, charming yet curt, socially domineering yet understated, casually psychopathic yet protective, sly yet straightforward, and somewhere between arrogant and confident. These traits have heavily psychosexual implications and are nauseating to read when played straight because they are clearly not designed to create consistent characterization or an interesting person, they are meant to walk the razor-thin edge of \"f*ckably dangerous\". This is all very directly reflected in how unobtainable women submit to the overwhelming raw sexual energy of the MC despite *minimal* interactions, with this series even going so far as to bring smell into it. Idk if this is meant to appeal to readers who are potentially attracted to the MC or simply be another layer for readers to project themselves onto, but either way it's insufferable even by power fantasy standards when the main character is OP Christian Grey. As a result of the above, there is absolutely nothing to humanize Sung Jin Woo. There is no room to create depth when any flaws or complexities must be spent building a carefully crafted dark-triad fantasy archetype. The superficial struggles the story presents (emotional or literal) only serves to highlight how poorly fleshed out our MC actually is. Any inner turmoil or kind act depicted is lip-service meant to pull SJW's character back from literal monster to Sigma Chad. Any mistake he makes or reckless action he takes is merely designed to build tension, as he never loses anything or faces real consequences. You can't even root for him from the perspective of zero to hero because after his reawakening he becomes literally and figuratively unrecognizable as the same character. The plot will also bend over backward to justify SJW's irresponsible actions via information he couldn't have possibly known, leaving people to die simply because of some convoluted logic he came up with at the moment. This is often done in service of preserving SJW's mystery and the \"big reveal\" where SJW whips out his huuuuge powers to the shock and awe of all the characters. Plot contrivances are also worked in to justify SJW's edgier moments Speaking of kind acts, with the notable exception of saving a wealthy D ranker, most heroics result in SJW garnering the affection of women, with men in the story being treated like cannon fodder. The only people treated worse than men are non-Koreans. This story manages to surpass even Baki in its xenophobia, which is a bit funny considering SK is rarely even mentioned in other types of comics. One-sided media rivalries like this reek of an inferiority complex, which is perfect for the target demo of this series, I guess. The foulest example I can think of to summarize many of these complaints is during the Jeju island arc, where the MC decides to hold off from helping to wipe out the poorly ripped-off chimera ants thanks to weak plot contrivances, only to have a bunch of Japanese people die horribly. It's okay though, because their boss was *evil* anyway, so SJW only shows up at the last second to save all the Koreans and unnecessarily proceeds to make sure he proves himself stronger than his opponent in every single aspect of combat before obliterating it (instead of doing the safer thing and bringing out his shadows from the beginning). Then, another male character who he previously snubbed makes a request of him, which he only acquiesces to after a bit of posturing because the other male character was respectful to SJW this time. I will give a nod to SJW's shadows, which will often have genuinely cute moments that are elevated by the art. Finally, our MC's motivations are not clear, which brings me to the plot. Plot 2/10: There is obviously a broader plot being alluded to. with the gates obviously being manipulated by some interdimensional godlike figure who is forcing all of these battles to happen (gives off some Gantz vibes), but SJW seems cooly detached from it, only vaguely pursuing the goal of obtaining strength or overcoming some obstacle that is directly in front of him, from saving his mom, to saving his friend, to avoiding detection, to making some money, to starting a guild, to overcoming whatever task the system gives him. Each arc usually culminates in some tensionless boss fight. The first chapters are boring, the first dungeon is moderately engaging, the rest of the story is terrible and feels like a mindless hack and slash video game with occasional creative flourishes. MC's shadow powers are kinda neat but are largely meaningless when it's obvious he will prevail every time regardless of his power set. There are occasionally developments, characters, and plot threads that seem interesting but go nowhere. The fact that SJW is the only character who can \"grow\" and has unlimited potential deflates any sense of tension or rivalry. The story has massive, gaping plot-holes all over the place, but will spend exorbitant amounts of time on trivial details or explaining an item/world/system mechanic, which all lack any sense of weight because they feel arbitrarily manufactured and poorly integrated into any other aspect of the story or the world in which these characters exist. Everything feels hollow, partially because of how flimsy the world-building is, and partially because it feels like the story exists inside a Korean fashion magazine with a coat of fantasy paint on top of it (sometimes the paint is even invisible since SJW can make his armor disappear so as not to diminish from his cool-guy persona). There is zero subtlety in the foreshadowing, and most of it revolves around random system mechanics that are used for plot convenience. You can tell pretty early on that every organization, character, etc. introduced largely exists just to JO the main character, his own special powers being the only thing that really matters (something CONSTANTLY reinforced by the author) Most of all, I'm just insulted by how much this series wastes your time. It will spend many chapters building up and introducing characters and plot elements, just to drop them or burn through them in one chapter for a single badass moment for SJW. Art: 9/10 The art is good. In the beginning, the anatomy is rough, but it cleans up over time and goes from feeling like a talented amateur to Korean Joe Madureira. Where it shines is the use of color and many graphic elements. Some panels are truly beautiful to look at, with flame effects, shadow effects, laser eyes, etc. They're all very well done and extremely polished. The panoramic shots in general tend to be exceptionally done. It even manages to utilize the single panel format better than a lot of others, with some creativity in panel placement. Enjoyment 2/10 Art is the one major redeeming quality. The shadows can be cute. Overall 2/10 If you want to read a Manhwa that is very similar to this, but I would say is worth reading through, Skeleton Soldier Couldn't Protect the Dungeon manages to work in a lot of the same elements, but in a much more satisfying and carefully crafted way, with characters that have genuine depth. It absolutely has some weirdly dissonant moments that seem to be common in Manhwa, but it improves on this general \"edgy OP MC\" formula in every way possible. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a power fantasy fix, read something written by a competent author like Overlord or Mushoku Tensei."}, {"score": "5", "content": "If this manhwa had to be described in one word, it would be 'overhyped'. With how much the manhwa had been lauded as the best series of its kind, and even a must-read, the reality falls disappointingly short of its expectations. Solo Levelling is mainly enjoyable for its art, with the plot and characters suffering from a lack of development and a general disinterest. Sung Jinwoo is known to be the weakest hunter alive, but still desperately attends dungeon clears in order to pay his mother's hospital bills. Unfortunately, abilities in this world are stagnant, meaning that it is impossible for him or any other hunter ... to grow stronger. But after a near-death experience, he is granted the opportunity to 'level up', gain new abilities and increased strength, but he also has to complete quests to avoid punishment. This premise, while not outstandingly novel, is still a fairly interesting one. Most notably would be his original weakness, as well as the possibility of incurring punishments. However, these plot points are immediately flipped upon its head, and never mentioned again. Despite the title of this manhwa being 'Solo Levelling', which would suggest the main character's quest to grow stronger as the major development in the story, Jinwoo becomes way too strong much too quickly. There is barely any struggle in his quest for strength as well, making the whole story lack any tension at all. The punishment quests only show up twice throughout the entire story, and he faces little to no consequences for anything. The story quickly becomes a power fantasy with the same formula repeating itself over and over: a new enemy which is more powerful than before shows up, which defeats every other character, but Jinwoo arrives to save the day. The concept of overpowered characters can be found all across media, each to varying levels of success. In Solo Levelling, the overpowered status of Jinwoo simply makes every other character redundant. His necromancy abilities give him enough summons that obey his every command which replaces other hunters in the story, who are simply too weak to do anything relevant. The other characters which begin to appear in Jinwoo's peripheral, pointed out to be the stronger of the bunch, end up useless as a whole. His shadow summons do not have an interesting personality either, with them being basically shadow puppets that are occasionally playful or slightly more angry than the next. Because the entire premise is that only Jinwoo is capable of growing stronger, the other characters show no development, neither in strength nor personality. They lack depth and exist only to make Jinwoo look better. And yet, Jinwoo himself does not have much more depth than the others. Throughout the manhwa, it seems that his personality is replaced with 'strong' and nothing else. He fights because he has to. His protection of humanity never appears to be a desire of his. Character relationships are another disappointment, mainly because they are utterly unemotional. Other than at the beginning of the story, there was no point which was convincing that Jinwoo would develop close relations with any other character. One of his biggest motivators before he grew stronger was to provide financial support for his family, but soon after he seems to forget them, or rather interactions between Jinwoo and his family are barely shown. The romantic beats end up unexpected, and not in a good way. The art is perhaps one of the only good points of the manhwa, but it does not really reach exceptional standards. And yet, it is still one of the better qualities. The popularity of Solo Levelling is what drew me to read it, but my experience with it was mediocre at best."}, {"score": "2", "content": "One-punch man without the self-awareness. ONE had at least the understanding to move away from the self-insert protgaonist to the setting to keep the story interesting. Solo Leveling does not do this, so it gets boring. But maybe that's the point? Maybe the author just wants to a create self-insert wish fulfilment story, and that's fine. The problem that arises when you set your ambitions so low is that you lose any emotional core. So for all the good stuff I could say about this, I can't score it very highly. At least God of Highschool tries to have some semblance of an emotional throughline ... with character arcs from the main cast of characters and villains. Meanwhile in Solo Levelling, the MC's mom's illness is established as a narrative hook and it's brought up again until 80 chapters deep into the story. Nothing shows the shallow writing of Solo Levelling than the cheap knock-off of the HxH Chimera Ant arc. I should mention a problem I personally have with the fights is that they fall down to classic trope of anime fights: Spamming the entire fight with light trails, so my eyes have more reason to glaze over all of it."}, {"score": "3", "content": "(CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS) So I've binged this in 2 days. I thought this was reeeeeally good and then I took a moment to think about it... I heard many good things and have seen it everywhere, so I decided to read it. The name popped in my head, and I'm like, \"Yeah let's read that. I'm bored.\" I'd say the only reason I've made it as far in as I did was bc I binged it. This is my first review so my apologies for bad formatting, etc. Story 3/10: We follow Sung Jin-Woo, basic main character, in a fantasy world of dungeon conquering, loot-gaining MMORP goodness. ... Pretty basic. Kinda like SAO but better in... no it's actually very similar to SAO. The beginning is really good. The arc where they're in that dungeon is awesome (more on that in the next paragraph). It seems every arc is the same formula, with NO differences (more on that later). Prologue 8/10: In a similar way to SAO, the first arc is actually pretty good in many ways. Not ground-breaking or fantastic, but actually not bad. They get trapped in a super dangerous room, there's rules they have to follow, lest certain death fall upon them. Stakes are reasonably high. Things are chaotic, and the read is intriguing. There's this mystery and dread behind it that drew me in. The creepy smile from the king statue brought back memories of the fish king dude from One Punch Man. That's a good thing. Again, the rules in this double room thing were awesome. Then, the useless MC was actually reliable and used his experience with near-death situations to be useful. I enjoyed it. The set up to the MC and to what I thought was the main female character were good. I'll go more into that later. However, the prologue and the impact it has are scarcely developed. Early on after that, the fear he felt during the prologue cause him to not have fear during the other dungeons. Compared to what he felt during that, nothing is bad in comparison. But. that's it. The rest of the stories are so repetitive. you know the formula. He goes into a gate, something unexpected happens, for instance the gate was more dangerous than it seemed. He handles it with ease despite the difficulty change. And then rinse and repeat. That's it. Art 10/10: The art is really good. It's outstanding. I have no idea how they are able to draw this amazing stuff AND COLOR IT in time. Anyone who's read it knows. Character 1/10: Oh boy here we go. MC is a Mary Sue. Basic self insert character for the insecure weebs who are unhappy with their life and want an escapist fantasy to delve into. I say this from personal experience. MC is edgy, bland, emotionless. There is nothing to say bc there is no character. There was a sub plot with his mom that was never developed. He was fighting so help pay for his mom's medical bills (she's comatose) and pay for his sister's way thru highschool and college. So that's about as much detail into those two things as we're given. There's no development or relation shown between him and his mom, no flashbacks. I could sufficiently describe his mother as this: his mom. There's no character there. She has a scar on her neck that he caused due to trying to... wash her hair with really hot water I think..? It wasn't exactly clear, but that's the closest to development we've seen there and that was about 70-80 chapters in at least. I have no reason to care for this woman because the author hasn't given me one. The sister is bland to. Thankfully, I don't recall any incest implications with the sister falling for MC, but maybe I'd prefer that to the pure nothingness we got. We get clue that she was smart and thought to be a nerd at school, but nope she's just a regular relatable girl at home. She's doing something medical, which is cool ig. Probably related to the comatose mother, but again, no development into that. One thing I thought would be super cool that was briefly touched on was him losing his emotions. It seemed like when he used the full status recovery when he was in a bind, that he'd lose more of his emotion. Or it was as he grew in level. I think they mentioned anger was one he couldn't feel anymore. I thought that was cool, but it was never mentioned again and he's shown kinda having emotion later in the sense that he saves all the female characters when they're in distress... which they always are, only to be rescued by our hero. As well, his power progression is ridiculous, he gets overpowered so quickly. I thought there'd be development and progression, watching him climb thru hard work. I thought it'd be a struggle. A couple of the first arcs were a struggle, but of course he overcame it after a sudden boost (status recovery reward). Then probably my favorite character was the B rank healer girl. She had an interesting character set up at the beginning. She was a B rank, but only went on E and D rank missions due to the fear she got from seeing those monsters, the deaths, etc. THAT WAS INTRIGUING. I was interested in how she'd struggle thru it, overcome it, and how the MC would help her. Things were looking good. Oh wait where'd she go? After the prologue she was just gone for awhile. It was mentioned she had worse trauma after the prologue and the events that transpired there, but no development. The MC never came to her to talk, help, anything. Never do we see her struggle. SHE GETS NO DEVELOPMENT. That made me sad. Instead, everything gets pushed aside to put the focus on MC getting stronger That's a common theme. Then we see her again, alongside one-armed dude. He was also kinda cool, but I could tell he'd get no development, so I didn't bother getting invested. If only I did that for every character. Then she doesn't face her trauma. She retires... Then there's a little exchange with her and MC, and he says he'll ask her on a date next time he visits her, which he never does. Then there's the little sister's friend. I thought there'd be development there. She was a highschooler who stopped going, bc she wanted to be a hunter. She was an E rank. The principal called MC in, bc he was a hunter and everyone loves him, to ask for advice and stuff. He then didn't talk to her much, but brought her to a dungeon with the White Tiger guild. She was gonna get some experience, but then nope. We don't see any interaction with her after they enter the dungeon. There's no conclusion to that sub plot they started. We don't see what she decided. Is she a hunter now? Is she gonna finish highschool at least like the teacher advised her to? No idea. Everything gets pushed aside to focus on MC getting stronger. Then there's the rich kid. He was kinda cool ig. Wish there was more development with him. Again, a common theme. Near the end of when I last saw him (idk if he's mentioned again after chapter 107) his father kicked him out, bc the kid wanted to be independent and join MC's guild (thought MC would make a guild. So far he hasn't). So he goes to MC asking to stay, MC says no, and we find out the kid slept in a hotel. He drops MC at the demon tower dungeon, and we never see him again. Did he find a home? Did he progress with the guild thing? What happened to him? No idea. All got pushed aside to focus on the MC getting stronger. Then there's that one s rank who could smell a difference in him. She fell for him bc: he's strong, he's the Mary Sue MC, and he was different. He has never had a legitimate conversation with her. I think there was brief interaction between the two in a group setting. That's about it. She was a damsel in distress that seemed cool but did nothing. Then there's the demon girl. Again, she had no character. I had my last hope for development in a female MC in her, even tho it was already like 90 chapters in. Course there wasn't any. It got pushed aside to focus on the MC getting stronger. She was just there to be another character for weebs to lust after. All females are cute, clumsy, damsels in distress. They all seem strong at first, but are brought to their knees in helpless powerlessness before our MC once the two of them interact. Men in the story are usually so unappealing for various reasons. I mean duh. We don't want there to be any potential that MC isn't the BC (best character). Enjoyment 6/10: This will probably get lowered the further I go on in my life. I enjoyed it kinda. It is NOTHING groundbreaking. It's a bad self insert shounen. Like a really bad one. But it looked AMAZING. Fights were REALLY cool. Seeing just how strong he got to be was cool. Just simply seeing the army come out and go ham on the enemy was REALLY fun to read. Usually the focus is ONLY on the one guy, but it slightly dispersed to the shadows when they were brought into action. Course only slightly tho. Don't want to distract from the MC. That'd be preposterous... Overall 3/10: This manga is bad. If you want something pretty to look at, and something INCREDIBLY HYPE and only that, then this is FANTASTIC at that. I heard ppl being like \"Yeah ToG had a bad anime adaptation, yeah GoH had a bad anime adaptation, but wait until Solo Leveling gets an adaptation. It'll be WAY better.\" I don't see it happening at all. It's gonna be rushed. It's gonna be bad, too. In this case, third time will not be the charm bc this isn't a good manga to work with. Admittedly, the prologue is like a 7/10 imo, so if they don't at least rush that then it'll maybe be decent. But seeing the other two adaptations, I have no reason to have high hopes for it."}, {"score": "3", "content": "If you want the premise of this story read the description on MAL because there's really nothing for me to add to that. To start with Solo Levelling sets itself up to be a series where we watch our protagonist Jin-Woo grow stronger by using his 'level up' ability. It's clear that it's just going to be a power fantasy, which is fine. The fundamental problem is that the story, world and characters are totally bland and uncompelling which is why I dropped this series after around 100 chapters. I don't care how powerful Jin-Woo is because cool fights don't make me want to read hundreds ... of chapters of a series. Cool fights get old really fast when you know what the outcome is always going to be and there's nothing else interesting about them. Before we get into that, I'll note the only good things about this series. It's got good art. You can't deny that so I won't try. People overemphasize how good it is, but it's definitely good. The premise itself is also interesting and reminds me of another isekai 'So I'm a Spider, So What?', where in that series we would watch our protagonist using their unique videogame abilities to analyse the world and carefully plan every move so that they can defeat enemies and grow stronger. Solo levelling isn't about these kind of interesting tactical fights because our main character goes from underdog to god very quickly. It felt like the series blew it's load super quickly because every character they introduced as being super strong became irrelevant compared to Jin-Woo by chapter 100. Regardless, our protagonist also changes his personality at some point from this nice but weak guy to edgy loner that everyone wants to fuck. It's confusing because it's not like he watches someone he loves die, he just becomes like this because he's strong. Maybe it makes some sense that he'd become detached given that he's a god however that really isn't fun to read because he's just boring now. What's his goal? He's already strong, so I guess become stronger. The fact that Jin-Woo doesn't have an interesting goal is a big problem because fights are usually meant to be a clash of viewpoints between two characters. When all our character desires is to be stronger then the fights lose any potential emotional weight. The villains he's fighting most of the time are also basically robots (it's implied that the enemies in gates are being controlled by someone, so they have no real reason to kill people other than that they are being forced to), so it's not interesting on that front either. The series eludes to the interesting point about how these god-like S tier hunters get to exist above the law and how maintaining order requires one guild to have a larger amount of S tiers. This gets forgotten about because Jin-Woo is stronger than S tiers so now we start seeing national level hunters talked about instead. There's an opportunity to explore the interesting politics of this world but instead we get to see chad thundercock Jin-Woo beat things up in different ways. So we have a boring protagonist and a boring world for him fight in. There's an overarching plotline forming throughout which is going to explain what gates are or whatever, but I just don't see any reason it would be interesting. And I guess that's about it. There are some stupid plots to talk about maybe, though mostly I just don't like Jin-Woo. He's an edge lord but without an interesting reason to be one. We find out about his ill mum like 60 chapters in I think and he fixes that almost immediately. Overall, just a terrible manhwa."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Just a note: This is my first review, so pardon me if it has odd errors or is formatted wrong. Why I must Write This Review: Essentially I have been forced to give this review, not out of the enjoyment I received from the series (although there is much), but simply to ask people to hold their final verdict until the story is closer to being completed. Although the story may not seem like it, majority of the important information of the series is withheld until later. This in turn, makes it appear as though the writer made people had powers ... just to have powers. This is not the case. Everything within the manhwa can be explained, just not until later. Think of it as a slowly unfolding mystery. I won't say anymore to avoid spoilers. Story: You can read the synopsis, I won't be restating it here. The story in the beginning seems simple, and possibly even bland to some. A classic zero to hero story, great. However, this simple outlook could not be more misguided. Just know that the story itself in the beginning is highly enjoyable to most people, while the writing near the end (which has not been shown yet outside of the LN) is very well done. This eventual reveal in the LN truly blew my mind, so I'm giving the manhwa a 10/10 since its been a truthful adaptation so far. Art: Nothing much to say. Fantastic art with its own unique style. Character: Unfortunately, the one thing that can't really be carried over from a LN is all the internal dialogue. I would give the LN protagonist a solid 10/10, but for a manhwa, it only gets an 8. He's still a good protagonist, and you can visibly see him change, but the effect isn't as strong as the LN. Enjoyment: The series is so enjoyable that its addictive. I blasted through the chapters lightning fast, and I didn't even realize. If nothing else, read the story just for a good time. Summary: Great art, great story (which has not been entirely revealed), and good character (great in LN). Would recommend to anyone."}, {"score": "9", "content": "OH boy. Its finally here. The most hyped webtoon currently airing. In the sea of straight 10s this is about to receive, I just wanna say if this really deserves it. Story: 7 First of all, if you aren't in the mood to read a complete zero to the absolute hero story then don't bother. In terms of story, Solo leveling doesn't do things that are too different or too unique but has enough fresh elements to keep the reader engaged. Our MC is very close to being the generic cool and overpowered light novel protagonist that we have come to accept. What makes him stand ... out is that we get to experience his growth in an RPG like system.This is what makes it automatically better than something like SAO which also has an OP protagonist but Kirito is so devoid of any personality and we have no believable information on how kirito attained the godlevel skills he has. It is very different in this as we see almost step by step the growth and evolution of our MC.Its nothing unique, but goddamn is it amazing. Art: 10 OMG the art is absolutely freaking amazing. This is without a doubt top 10 in the art department and can hold its own again mangas like sunkenrock. Its all in colour which adds to the badassery. This is the main source of enjoyment for me. The colouring is so amazing as the colour are so vibrant and breathe life into what is still images. This is without a doubt the most hype i have had reading a manhwa. The hype here is equivalent to one punch man and kingdom. Characters: 8 Honestly, the characters aren't anything special but they are extremely entertaining. Most characters are sidetracked to make our MC more cooler. We are too early in the story for me to actually talk about certain characters that i find interesting. The fights is where the manhwa truly shines. As the art feels top notch and the flow from one panel to other is absolutely crisp. Honestly, it feels like reading something animated. The only mangas that have given me something like this is probably Blade of the immortal or One punch man. The opening arc might just be one of the best intro arcs i have ever read. It was genuinely creepy and so interesting and sets the stage of whats to come perfectly. One of the issues I have with this is the repetition that plagues the story. Almost every dungeon raid is miscalculated. Enjoyment: 10 I cant help but binge this. This manhwa has almost perfect pacing and doesn't feel like its slogging in certain areas or going too fast.And when i started reading this, every other manga was on hold for me. I had so much fun binging this its probably my favorite thing i did this summer. Overall: 9 Is this over-hyped in the community? Yeah. It is. But it is definitely worth a read. There isn't really anything deeper to this conceptually. And this is intended for a younger audience as story is pretty basic. The thing most people praise it for is it being bad-ass. And that is pretty much the only reason why most people should read this. It doesn't deserve a 10 as it still is pretty basic and quite generic in certain areas."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Most about the manhwa is average, no, it's slightly worse than average except for the art, it's very good.The execution and the pacing is also good. However, it doesn't have properly developed characters, only the protagonist pretty much got what can be called 'character development', and once he gots that, it's pretty much stagnant. The plot is crappy and generic too. It focuses more on action and artstyle. The protagonist pretty much nails it all, he seldom have any struggle against something after the beginning part of the story. It's also way too edgy... like a 12 year old's edgy delusions. TOTALLY OVERRATED. 5/10"}, {"score": "1", "content": "Solo Leveling is a masterclass in how to take an interesting premise and grind it into oblivion with repetitive storytelling and zero character development. The protagonist, Sung Jin-Woo, transforms from a weakling to an unstoppable god with the emotional depth of dry toast. Every fight plays out like clockwork: enemies show up, everyone else gets obliterated, and then—like a bad habit—Jin-Woo shows up at the last second to clean up with minimal effort. It’s not suspenseful, it’s just lazy writing dressed in black smoke and glowing eyes. The world itself is paper-thin, populated by NPC-like side characters who exist solely to be saved or to worship ... Jin-Woo’s absurd power. Plot threads are dropped faster than bodies in a dungeon, and any potential intrigue is immediately smothered by another convenient power-up. Even the flashy art can’t distract from the fact that you’re reading the same fight on repeat, just with a new monster skin. Solo Leveling isn’t a story—it’s a glorified highlight reel for a protagonist who never shows up until everyone else is already half-dead."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I really appreciate the contribution the African Americans in this piece of literature. I mean I like the colors on this manhwa... and the art is spectacular, rivaling the quality of other acclaimed manga while having it's appealing art style not become too generic. The linework is clean and backgrounds are almost always present. The story is about what you expect from a typical shonen, but the execution, the how, meaning the world building, the suspense and tension, the catharsis the mc invokes, is done very well. This manhwa primarily for: people who wanted more from SAO and were disappointed by the direction it goes for after ... episode 3, people who like SAO, people who like isekai trash, people who dislike generic iseaki trash, but want something refreshing with action, and people who like action. Just start reading it. Also since it's Korean it's left to right (like english) and since it is meant for online consumption it means you scroll down to continue. I mean for me, a person who is english and consumes manga online, this is really nice. If you are familiar with the isekai genre and how they implement mechanics from modern rpgs, this story does basically the same, but frames it to feel different enough. Instead of your mc dying and reincarnating gaining some cheat ability in a pseudo medieval fantasy world, the setting takes place in the modern world. \"Gates\" exist which function the same as dungeons and monsters from these \"gates\" will wreck havoc unless controlled. The story begins with everyone already used to the existence of gates and \"hunters\", a potential career path for people completing the dungeons. The setting the author presents is an ecosystem revolving around these two elements and it is \"logically\" expanded upon in the background. And this isn't even why I like it so much! It's just a factor. Also it's updated regularly on a weekly basis which is more than what you can get on other really good manga so you don't have to wait a year for 2 chapters..."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I'll keep this short. What is it sometimes that makes a manga or manhwa so different yet so enjoyable at the same time. I'm sure you know it's just the coloring and preference in my opinion. Few people or readers sometimes find this cheezy. But this is a manhwa that contains art which legit is on another freaking level and that may change other's opinions on manhwa. Story: 9/10 I know this is a typical story for any manhwa. Whenever a story introduces a weak character in time he/she becomes strong as freak to defeat his/her foes and yeah, that's too typical, so that's a negative. But ... the main twist is that this has various monsters, powers, characters that is sometimes hard to remember/maintain in story. Yet it's done very cautiously so people don't forget the protagonist's main powers and goals. Art: 10/10 What do you want me to say other than, \"this is a fucking master piece\" ?? I freaking wish that I could have given a higher score but I just can't. This manhwa's art is on another freaking level I'll tell you that. Every single detail on every other single chapter is not left out. Whatever previous chapters contained those artistic detail was in the present one (if any flaws I dunno, I was just too much involved and enjoying). Also after every new chapter comes out the art seems to get better and better with coloring, shading, highlighting, and much more. Characters: 9/10 Though it introduces many characters through out time it introduces them very-very poorly and then leaves them aside or re-introduces them after a long time in the story. Though the plus point about this manhwa is that this solely focuses on the protagonist's growth and does not even leave out the little details on him that may have been given to the readers in the previous chapters. That's quite rare and interesting because it may bore the reader in time but it just doesn't. Character development is always done in some amazing style which always catches the eye. Enjoyment: 10/10 Man does this manhwa has some seriously annoying cliffhangers but the art, fighting, and the story keeps you so much freaking involved and hooked to it you just may get some goosebumps as well or just re-read the whole freaking chapter. It's just too enjoyable. Overall: 10/10 Overall this really is an amazing piece of art. Give it a shot."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Amazing. Simply amazing. One of the best action series I've ever seen. The concept is also very cool. Sung Jinwoo starts off as a lowly E level, and you get to see him rank up, basically by video game concept. Each enemy he defeats he gets stronger and acquires new items. Though the premise sounds simple, it's the story around it that makes gives it the push into legendary status. The series does an amazing job with world building. You are intrigue by the gates. By the guilds. By the monsters. By- well basically everything. I want to know more, and can't believe such an amazing ... series only got 12 episode (thank goodness for season 2). The show does just enough to explain to the viewers what's going on, but also leaves enough for intrigue. In terms of character, well there's really just the MC that stands out- and that's okay. The show is call solo leveling, right? I mean other characters exist, but they're really just there to support the MC. The interaction is subpar by standards, but again- the world building is so good that you don't mind. Speaking of MC, how is Jinwoo? I like him a lot. He's got unlimited grit and determination, but unlike your typical shounen protagonist- this dude does what has to be done, i.e. killing when necessary. I mean he has to if he wants to survive. But he's also got morals and is very kind. His goal after all, is to save his mother and support his younger sister. However, I like that the show shows him teetering between good and evil sometimes. In terms of action, well it's definitely A+. Beautiful animations. Beautiful fight scenes. Amazing power up moments. If I don't want to say more because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I went into this anime pretty much blind, and I think that's the best way. Solo Leveling is definitely one of my favorite animes of all time. 10/10, no questions ask."}, {"score": "4", "content": "\"It's easy to be strong and rough; it's easy to be weak and gentle, but it requires the highest degrees to possess both strength and gentleness\". In this review it won't be intended to inform you guys of the obvious; the (seemingly not so much) common sense stuff: the protagonist of this mahnwa is a self-insert Gary Stu. What shall be discussed here is a more glaring issue though: the kind of character the fans and especially the author are self-inserting themselves into. Other people here have already done an excellent job discussing many of its vices (and qualities, e.g. the art). Thus, let's start from the ... beginning: Sung Jin-Woo is a low-level young man whose mother is ill and, despite his noble efforts to pay for her medical fees through doing \"dungeons\", he's scorned by everyone around him due to his physical weakness. Nonetheless, he proves to have a different set of strengths; one seemingly uncommom amongst his colleagues: courage, braveness, selflessness and a pure heart. After showing us all his virtuousness, he's rewarded by his deeds with... \"OPness\", \"Gary Stu'dom\", plot armour. He keeps up with his work after the introductionary events until we get to the 20th chapter or so, wheareas he teams up with a group of jerks who try to leave him for dead inside the dungeon. In this situation, one could've thought: \"Ok, it's time for him to show yet again his kindness and mercy to those who did him wrong à la Viland Saga\". No, he cold-bloodly kills every single one of them in the most cruel way he could. The plot follows like that for a few more chapters without any chance of redemption. Instead of developing sympathy, forgiving others and maybe trying to help the world by doing more difficult dungeons now that he is so \"strong\" (alas, only physically), the path Sung Jin-Woo decides to take is one of seeking solace to his bitterness in others when he can only find it within himself. Once \"reawakend', his death instinct is unstoppable (as in \"Light's Syndrome\") and the author starts desperately trying to create different convenient situations which allow him to release it without much moral consequences afterwards. He adds a ton of \"garbage\" human beings across his path so Sung can have an \"excuse\" to show his real, genuine face. Although truly hurt inside, our mangaka keeps supressing his feelings and even endorsing his actions without realising that, in real life, it would only be leading him more and more towards doom. It should go without saying that what the protagonist of \"Solo Leveling\" really needs is not getting more powerful so he can completely destroy his already poor mental health, but a psychotherapist. He has good friends and also people who worry about him, thus I don't understand what's so glorious about seeing him waste his life for the sake of revenge when he could be... better than that. It's not realistic, but sad, morbid and distateful. This depiction of strength leaves brains and morals completely aside. It's indeed \"Solo Leveling\", but levelling down nonetheless."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Quest: Read this manhwa Rewards: Get to go on an insane journey with a badass character Do you accept? “He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster...when you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you” - Friedrich Nietzsche (For those who haven't read Solo Leveling yet, I've marked where the spoilers begin, so you can read till there unless you're fine with being spoiled ^_^) In the beginning, I didn’t have very high expectations for any manga/manhwa (much less think I would write a review for it, but look at me now). It never gave me the ... hype that anime did, especially in the case of fight scenes. In my eyes, manga was always inferior to anime, that is, until I read this….. If I were to describe this manhwa in a few words, I would call it a perfectly paced story, having insane fights, gorgeously illustrated, with comedy drizzled in all the right places. In short, something that exceeds a masterpiece. With the perfect blend of character development, emotion, story, and explosive fights, this manhwa captivates the reader completely. Once drawn in, I wanted to read more and more. Story and illustration Had me enraptured throughout. There wasn’t a single chapter where I felt bored. Not many manga can consistently be interesting, but this completely blew away the norm. Every panel was beautifully drawn, for a solid storyline. Many mysteries were revealed, and many deciphered. Each fight scene was drawn in such a way that I felt as if I was there seeing it with my own eyes. I usually only get chills when I see really well animated fights in anime, but this manga completely blew away that view and gave me chills in almost every fight. The art never failed to impress, with each panel being detailed right down to the finest level. (Spoilers ahead) The weakest hunter, putting his life on the line just so he could support his ailing mother and fund his sister’s education, is how the story starts. The stronger hunters, not having a care in the world, lived their life pompously, while the weaker hunters strived to even earn a meagre wage. It brings into our perspective, how society is divided. Even though the strong and weak were close to each other geographically, they were miles away metaphorically. Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank, worked his ass off, disregarding his own safety in order to support his mother and sister. Due to an unfortunate event, he got trapped in a double dungeon, but due to his quick intellect, he managed to decode the hidden puzzles, and save whoever he could. In the end, he was the only one left, choosing to sacrifice himself to save the others. Death was clutching his neck, ready to snap it at any moment, but destiny had other plans for him. After passing out, he awoke to find within him, a power of unknown origin. Using his newfound ability, he transformed from a weak person who frequently got hurt, to a badass dude ready to protect his family and friends, whatever may come his way. This can clearly be seen, where he chose to protect his father, even if it meant going against every single hunter. Not just his family, but Sung even cared for his friend (pretty much like a brother to him ;) a lot, even if he was comparatively much weaker. The emotional impact these scenarios created in me was immense. It made me realise how much my parents and close friends meant to me, and made me realise I would go against even the world to protect them. Overall, its plot was perfect, infused with all the right elements at the right proportion. Characters I could go on and on about how I love all the characters, and how each have their own individual charm, but I’ll just focus on a few characters briefly and on the protagonist mainly, because he is the one we are most exposed to, and through whose eyes we see this magnificent plot unravel. Jin-Ho Yoo- A character I loved the instant they introduced him. Funny, righteous and loyal are just some of his loveable traits. They way he tried to protect Sung even before he knew of Sung's power, and choosing to stand beside him when threatened by Hwang Dong-Suk to kill him, showed he what kind of a character he was. Him telling Sung that he considered him as an older brother, and Sung telling him he’ll consider him as a younger brother made my heart jump for joy. Hae-In Cha (her just straight up admitting she liked Sung was really hilarious lol), Gun-Hee Go (was so sad when he died, rip legend), Jong-In Choi, Jin-Chul Woo ,Yoon-Ho Baek, Esil Radiru (One second she tries to murder Sung, the next she begs for forgiveness, only to try murdering him again lmao) -All epic people. But their names are so hard to remember. Shadow soldiers: Beru, Kaisel, Igris, Tank, Iron (and all the other shadow soldiers who appeared later) -They’re all so cool. Each have their own individual character, which deepens their personality. Now for the character I’ve been waiting to talk about. The MC who’s more badass than the villains (*insert badass music of your choice here) Sung Jin-Woo One of the most badass characters I’ve seen, the epitome of cool. Going against the world to protect those close to him, he’s the renegade we all deserved. A minimum number of people needed to clear a gate? Oh, don’t mind me and my army clearing it ourselves. It’s not just his attitude and mindset, but his abilities too. They’re nothing short of amazing. Shadow Extraction, Ruler’s Authority, Bloodlust and Mutilation are just some of his staggering abilities. Is it just me, or does Shadow Extraction and Preservation give off Pokemon vibes? A badass MC with badass abilities who will do his best to protect those he cares for, what more do you want? (He rampaged into my top 3 favourite characters faster than him summoning his shadow soldiers.) Finally, the ending. You know that feeling when an amazing anime or manga betrays you in the last second with a shitty ending? Yeah, Solo Leveling didn't have that. Rewinding time to save everyone while carrying the burden all by yourself? It's eveything I had hoped for but better. Was very glad to know that in the end, Sung and everyone who had stood for him got a happy ending. (I really hope this manhwa gets an anime adaptation soon!) Thanks for reading till here. Hope you enjoyed reading this review.(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ V4Wather out."}, {"score": "1", "content": "NOTE THIS IS ONLY FOR THE 180 chapters (This has been pasted since my old account has been deleted) Solo Leveling is by far MAL's favorite manhwa or Korean Manga, yet there are sides to saying its peak fiction to saying it's absolute trash. Quite frankly, I dug into the hype of this manhwa, and it didn't take me long for solo leveling to show its true colors. Thus, it became of the worst things and biggest time-wasters in fiction I have ever read. Art 7/10 The art is the high point of this manhwa, where the character designs are well done, and the monsters and fight scenes are ... well drawn and colored. Nothing more to say. It's just amazing; sadly, the illustrator died because he could’ve used his talent to be one of the best illustrators of Manwha History if he was still alive. Story 2/10 The art only carries this manhwa, but here we enter the lousy part of the Manhwa, the story; the story revolves around these so-called “Gates” that appear, which brings a link between the everyday world and the magical world filled with magic and monsters. Then ordinary people go into said dungeons to mHunterquick buck. Enter Jin Woo, who initially is the weakest Hunter in the story and makes a living being a hunter to pay for his Mom’s hospital bills. After one failed mission, he finds himself in a hospital three days later with a questHunteraking him train hard, which in turn causes him the best hunter. This plot is very generic since we have seen this million times in Isai or power fantasy anime. Still, at least it sounds interesting to develop it to make it enjoyable, right? Sadly that isn't the case for this manhwa. The story is severely made to see the main character progressively go from weakling to the most powerful. It's like playing any browser game like a cookie-clicker or just wasting time grinding on one thing to be overpowered, like killing monsters. Worldbuilding elements are not there since we don't know how the gates appeared in the first place, and the author was pretty lazy about how they came in the first place. It goes like MC enters a dungeon, kills the monsters/boss, gets more powers afterward, rinses, and repeats that about 7-8 times. It's all fighting which, apparently, is to entertain the reader and not add any value to the already generic story. The ending is also VERY unsatisfying because it ends the most bullshit way possible of just undoing all your work, making this read be NOTHING worth it. Jin Woo just decided to make all his hard work go away to bring back every character, which was a wtf moment, and I just read this for NOTHING. Character 1/10 Speaking of which, Here we go; the worst part of the whole thing is the characters; Jin Woo is an ABHORRENT character. He is bland like baby food and is a Gary Stu type, battling the gate creatures and becoming mighty. He has no clear morals or emotions and just gets hugely overpowered. The only part other than the ending part that makes him at least somewhat interesting is the whole Hospital scene with his mother showing some emotion, but that is quickly forgotten about or brought back. He is just an overpowered, edgy character with no apparent motives who hacks and slashes toward any danger he is in. No depth whatsoever! As for the side characters, the Males ones are just there for some reason since, well, you won’t care about them nor remember their existence after each arc because they aren’t even developed at all. They are just there to be a measuring tool to see how powerful our beloved MC is and help him tackle all the beasts he fights in each arc. The Female side characters only exist to serve to fall for him because all of them have no or just forced character development and have emotions for him to make him more like a “chad.” Enjoyment 0/10 Unfortunately, I have to give this a 0/10, but this manga didn't start with no entertainment since the first 26 chapters promised that this story could expand more, which is a solid 5/10 start. But as said in the Story and Character Section, it drops to 0.5/10, which rounds up to a 0 because appreciating the art is the only good part, and me going through rubbish writing is not fun at all. Me finishing it was a chore, to be honest, and I would've have dropped this around chapter 103 Overall 1/10 This manhwa is entirely wretched. I can't understand why this is hyped, with people saying, “It’s a masterpiece.” Every damn time the art and fights carry the whole manhwa while trapping the average reader, making them ignore all the wrong things with this. The author was highly incompetent in writing a good story that was par with the art. I understand why people like this because of the powering-up fantasy, but I can recommend this who like battle shonen just carried by the fights if you are like me that got duped thinking this is a compelling story, then I would recommend skipping this one since if you want to finish this, you would be treating that like a chore or pretty much dropping it after the 3rd arc. Or here’s a TL: DR Good parts: Fantastic artwork, some traces of serious potential Bad parts: Unlikable mc, very generic plot, non-existent world-building, and useless side characters"}, {"score": "5", "content": "Aight let's get straight to the point, shall we? I will make this as short as possible. Zero spoiler. Art 9/10 The art is insanely good. For me, I like the art in the fights scene the most. When fighting occurred, you can feel the movement of the attack, especially when the fight is happening at high speed. You can feel the speed and the motion. It was brilliant but nothing unique. Character 1/10 You would think that i will be praising when you're reading the art section but sikeee. That is justa clickbait. Gottem. Ehem. Every character in this Manhwa is unbelievably boring, and if I ... would pick the most boring character, it will be the MC himself. The mc went from a cliche weak-ass character to the most op character ever. He went so op that it gets so boring to watch, and I was rooting for the villains to at least deal some damage to him but nope. The mc defeated his opponents with a perfect KO. The mc sees everyone like trash. He even treated someone who approaches him in a manner like a dog. How can you even like a character like this??? I get that he has a sad past, but should he disrespect everyone he doesn't like? Seriously I wish this mc can a taste of his own medicine. But zannen, he was too op that he can do whatever he wants—super insanely unlikeable characteristics. Mc Went from a likable weak character to an unlikeable op character. Zero respect to anyone. Mc doesn't give a fk. Lastly, If there is a slight chance to make the mc look cool, the author won't miss that opportunity so that every female character will have a feeling towards the Mc, and I hate it so fk much. I would have loved it if the Mc just act lowkey in every situation, but instead, he trashed anyone he wanted to. I mean, can we have a normal storyline so without wetting any female character or vice-versa? Is it really necessary to make every female character drooling for mc's dick? fk man. The mc is so fk boring. Enough with Mc. Let's talk about the side character. First of all, every single fk side character got attracted to the Mc too easily. Especially the female character. I get it that the Mc is op. But did he had any pussy-magnet or something? Man, why man, just why. Please tell me I'm not the only one who hates this type of character and the mc. The top fighters in the nation were fodder compared to the mc (so far). You can't help but have zero feelings towards the side character. They are just there for the sole purpose of hype the Mc. None of them can even lay a scratch on Mc. In short, trash side characters and unlikeable Mc. Story 4/10 Just ok. Nothing special. Zero to hero Mc. I mean op mc. It feels as if the world is orbiting on Mc's. Every time he is in the dungeon, something terrible or unpredictable will occurred. Again, just so that the mc can save everyone ass and be a hero. It feels so forced. The world-building is pretty good, actually, and I like the dungeon thing and more. Enjoyment 4/10 Although I hate the mc, I somewhat enjoy the series. If only the Mc is not a fk bastard and cool guy. This Manhwa would have been even better. Tbh, I like it the most when the Mc is not around and the side character is fighting. With this, the fight will become unpredictable and better at building suspense. Overall 5/10 In short, overhyped. Overrating. Trash Mc. Fk the Mc. But even then, I would still recommend reading it because it might just be me who hate it."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Review contains minor spoilers Oh, my, god. What the hell 8,91?!!? That’s higher than ToG’s(Tower Of God) Holyy, well here we go Ohh Solo Leveling. I know i’m late to the SL train but, we’ve all heard of this series, whether it be social medias, anime/manga websites, or maybe you just heard of it from a friend. Now, you might ask, “Is Solo Leveling Good?” Or “Does Solo Leveling live up to the hype? Well, no but actually, no. Solo Leveling does not live up to the hype. People will say it’s the “best manwha ever”, or “It has the best plot”, we also have a lot ... of biased reviews. To tell you the truth, it’s overrated. It’s the definition of overrated. Well here’s my point of view in this review. Story: The first 40 chapters were good(i guess), but after chapter 45 or so, it started to declinel In terms of plot, there’s little plot. Now, we all have to remember this is a battle shounen. Battle Shounen’s with actual plot that is good are rare these days. So i’ll just one up my score. But to SL’s story. Well, the story is really nothing unique. It’s your same old “weak-guy-becomes-strong-after-getting-a-powerup” trope. It adds nothing new, we just have the formula of: “Disaster happens, filler fights, Jin-Woo arrives, where the good shit happens, looks badass, end.” That’s basically the whole story. And after chapter 128 Solo Leveling tries to be interesting by pulling a Kurama and Naruto. This fails, as the Carton Temple felt very very very very fast-paced, and ultimately fails as an arc. Sure the sovereign reveal was interesting, but it takes so long for them to actually expand in that. One thing i’ll give to Solo Leveling tho is World-Building and how realistic the system is and how it would affect this world if it ever happened, so, props to them. In summary, Solo Leveling is a generic power-trip with a badass mc, it also trys to be interesting but fails, due to lack of expansion. And yes, i did read the Novel. It was boring.(5/10) Characters: Oh here we are. The characters. I’ll keep this short since there’s really nothing to say about them. The characters are really just filler, and just are there to tell us how badass the MC is. They have no personalities whatsoever, and the rare ones that actually have personalities either. A. Don’t have enough screen-time B. Have the most generic bullshit personalities in the entirety of comics/manga. The only interesting ones are Jin-Woo and His Father. Overall(3/10) Art: Possibly Solo Leveling’s strongest point. The Art is gorgeous, and each panel gives off the atmosphere of the situation. This is probably why Solo Leveling gets most of it’s love.(100/10) Enjoyment: Although i bashed SL alot in this review, i still really enjoyed this. Power fantasy trash is a guilty pleasure of mine, and sometimes i just wanna turn off my brain and watch an MC slay some mofos. The only real reason i made this review is to get off my chest on how overrated it its, even tho it’s one of my favorite’s.(8/10) Overall score: 5"}, {"score": "5", "content": "After being in the anime/manga community I too came across the overly popular manhwa called solo leveling. With its 8.9 score and strong reviews, I expected a so-called masterpiece, but oh boy was I wrong. This review will contain spoilers you've been warned! First, let's talk about the story, but there is nothing really to talk about. It's your generic week guy \"dies\" gets op powers and beats the shit out of everyone he doesn't like. BuT hE hAs To Do DaIlY qUeStS tO gEt StRoNg yeah no shit, but I don't think doing 100 push-ups a day is a big enough quest on its own to ... get this powerful this fast. It's nothing special compared to an MMORPG power fantasy, but it has so many weaknesses and plotholes. First of all the world around us and how it works is extremely poorly written with little to no explanation whatsoever (like the gates or the government or even the classes like mage or assassin are just thrown at us out of nowhere). The other major problem is the repetitiveness of the story. Every so-called \"arc\" can be summarised in a short sentence, which is: Good guy goes into the dungeon, something bad happens, but it doesn't really matter because the good guy will always win at the end. (Even though it's my personal opinion I hated how the always referred to the first quest of the story multiple times even though it happened like 15-20 chapters ago) The \"bad guys\" are plain with no original motives or powers whatsoever. And sometimes the story just straight up makes no sense at all (a criminal who's most likely \"C\" tier gets defeated by an \"E\" lvl dungeon boss, or the main character can clear an \"S\" type dungeons defender but then struggles against a \"C\" type dungeon boss and a \"B\" type assassin right after, even though the hunters can fell the strength of monsters or others, but they clearly can't use this ability when it can be used effectively in certain situations) And oh boy the dungeons. Every dungeon feels the same, maybe except for the first one. I didn't understand why the writers refused to use more complicated, puzzle-like dungeons (like the first one in the story). I think it would have made a huge difference, because as I mentioned earlier every dungeon follows the same roots, which gets old early on. The \"Characters\" You may be wondering, why I used the marks, but let me tell you, how weak these characters are. Weak isn't even fitting. They are disposable and hollow. Even though we get some character introduction very early on, it is truly disappointing how little their development is. For example, we get a younger sister, an ill mother, a cute healer, and 2 old geezers, but they just feel like clouds floating in the air, with no effect on the world nor the story. Same with the villains. No originality, no foreshadowing, we just get to the next arc, Great! time to meet a new template bad guy. BUT WORST PART IS NON OTHER THAN THE MAIN CHARACTER HIMSELF. in the first chapters, he feels much more relatable being weak and wanting to overcome the weakness, but he just becomes a plain \"edgy badass\" main character with no characteristics. He just does whatever he wants with no consequences, and he just doesn't feel like a real character anymore. The only positive element is the art. It is truly breathtaking. Every page feels like a masterpiece when you look at it. The colors and the poses are all well-fitting, it's just sad that it is the only thing keeping this manhwa alive in my personal opinion. If you just want to read something, where you don't have to use your brain. and just turn the world off for a couple of hours, you can go ahead and enjoy this killing/edgelord orgy. I don't think it is totally unreadable or unenjoyable, but I just can't see the point of this being the most popular/highest rated manhwa on the website. I started Solo Leveling with high expectations, and I really wanted to like it as much as others did, but the more I read the more problems and holes I found. The whole story just feels empty. It has no soul to it. If I have to compare it to something, I would say it's Sao's edgy older brother but sadly nothing else."}, {"score": "7", "content": "This is my thoughts about this series right after I finished it, I kept any spoilers to a minimum possible while still giving a generic overview of the story: Everyone hyped this series too much so i guess i was a little disappointed. The art is great and the action too, but at least for me... There is a crucial aspect missing in Solo Leveling. And that is \"story\". Don't get me wrong, thing do certainly happen, but, when you look at the overall story, it doesn't have much going on besides the mc(main character) finding a strong enemy, getting stronger to beat it up, and then repeating. The world ... building is quite good so it doesn't feel as plain as other stories that follow similar pattern..... BUT.... WHERE ARE THE OTHER CHARACTERS??? Let me know them. Let me care for them. Let me see them more, instead of just showing them to give a simple speech or to say \"This guy seems different\"+\"How can you be so powerful?!\" and forgetting these people until the mc needs them again. This \"little\" thing really took away most of the fun in this series for me. I can't get too sad when someone dies, or feel that a romance makes sense if the characters involved just show up in this bland fashion. And as such, my favorite part in the whole series is the start and the side stories, because that's where I can finally know some of the characters I'm reading about."}, {"score": "3", "content": "So, Solo Leveling, the manhwa everyone reads and everyone praises and defends but in the end its just another dungeon based manhwa with a character that is weak and gets strong so fast you might not even notice. The art is great, redice did a wonderful job here but thats where the good things end, the story is generic and boring, its the classic \"oh no dungeons have appeared what are we gonna do bam op normal guy appears\" but it doesnt take place when the dungeons start but some time after, the characters oh god the characters, sung jin woo barely had any character development ... in the last 150 chapter other than getting stronger and the other characters are barely memorable, tell, do you remember the name of the chairman of the hunter association? do you remember anyone from the jeju island event? did you care when they died in the jeju island incident? probably not, because all of them feel like background characters that sometimes speaks and are supposed to be the strongest of the storngest but get killed by anything so that sung jin woo can be shown as the strong character he is. if the characters were a bit more developed it would've been a 9/10 for me but that just kills the manhwa."}, {"score": "4", "content": "My biggest disappointment in 2019. Visuals won't be the problem but the story. The characters are thrown in the story without depth/development. Many of them (especially the antagonists) were killed instantly without leaving an impact on the readers. Likewise, the supporting characters were not given any color but fawners of the main character. You can see the disregard for important characters in the family of the MC. The father arrived in action, then died without giving us any backstory. The sister just became a tool for the MC to show off his enraged side. While the mother was just a lame excuse for the ... MC to level up that did not even allow the readers to sympathize with because we are more interested in his fighting. Overall, the family that should be the drive of the MC is superficial. No love, care, or attachment in these characters. Solo leveling is the antithesis of One Punch Man or Mob Psycho (Or even the classic Dragon Ball) on how it treats overpowered MCs in developing stories. He is just a plain \"Gary Stu\" (I cringe when I used this pretentious term). I read the manga because it was promising with the visuals and good pacing of the story, but the impression didn't last long. I tried to redeem it by going to the source novel; however, it was faithful to the material so my disappointment lived up. Hahaha, it was wishful thinking."}, {"score": "1", "content": "\"Solo Leveling\" is more akin to \"Zero Leveling\", because not a single character develops throughout the entirety of 179 chapters. It's just boring and has been done thousands of times before. Not a single character (no exaggeration) is likeable or interesting. Overall, the plot is very predictable and the protagonist never really has to struggle. If you want to read manhwa, Solo Leveling is a good starter, but after you read a some more (better) works, you'll begin to realize that it's all the SAME. Solo Leveling is a story full of clichés and bad world building that reminds me of kindergarten when I'd play ... \"pretend\" with my friends. We'd go back and forth being like \"okay so I punch you and you die\" and \"no, actually I was wearing diamond protection IV armor with thorns enchantment so you died instead\" and \"okay well I punched you in your weak point so you're down\" and \"no my full body is coated in netherite so I don't have any weak points\" etc. etc. The hype of each battle loses flare since it's hard to get attached to characters who lack backstory and development, which is worsened by the fact that ALL side characters are tossed to the back and never get any screen time; beyond that, pretty much every fight ends up with the MC stepping in like a badass and saving the day. Standard stuff. There was one side character in particular that I had hopes for: the MC's love interest. She was introduced in an interesting way that hinted at perhaps a bigger motivation or mystery to her history. However, this line of plot was never explored. It is highly disappointing how the side characters are treated in Solo Leveling-- it's not just this girl that wasn't able to meet expectations. It's so frustrating when characters that have been hyped up throughout the entire story are finally introduced, only to be met with immense letdowns as the protagonist swiftly defeats them without breaking a sweat. Yet despite all these achievements, even the protagonist feels very plain. He has no defining character traits; you could replace him with any other battle manhwa male lead with black hair and edgy personality and nobody would ever notice the difference. He has no internal or external struggle because he is able to overcome any problems almost immediately with zero buildup. It becomes formulaic to watch. Stupid plot and bland characters that only serve as plot devices to make the MC look cooler. The story feels very retconned because none of it is character driven. I can't name a single memorable feat by any character besides the MC. Don't waste your time, but if you like low substance power fantasy type of story, go ahead. Solo Leveling is a chill kind of read though, especially because you can just turn off your brain and enjoy the flashy fight sequences. The art gets considerably better as the chapters go on, but I still give this series a 1/10 because it does not make up for the awful character writing."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Hello all, This is my first time writing a review and I can say that this reminds me so much of many many good Anime startups like SAO and I can say that I was mesmerized when I first started reading it. I was going from chapter to chapter with such hunger for more, took me 8 straight hours to catch-up and I could simply not get enough of it. Story: 10/10 Simply grabbing you by the neck and chockeslamming you, like a wrestle mania moment. When you start with the first chapter you simply can't get enough of the weak character, who is always depressed and scared ... of dying but he finds his way with hard work and blood to the very special place. Art: 10/10 The coloring of the chapters and fights is very very good and gives you an exact feeling what will it look if this was turn to an Anime which I would pay to see to be honest. Characters: 10/10 It presents not only the main-character as a weakling but shows the compassion of the people around him. Also showing how he goes when he starts to obtain power and his character slowly evolves into something more, a true bad-ass-hero. Enjoyment: 10/10 As I said few times already, I simply can't shake off my hunger for it. It is really amazing manga and I wish to continue reading even if they go full \"One Piece\" number I will not get bored of it. Overall: 10/10 Nothing left to say but give it a shot and start reading it! You will not be sorry, Solo leveling is simply on a next level compared to other mangas."}, {"score": "4", "content": "Whoever denies that Solo Leveling is far from a masterpiece, seriously hasn't noticed how repetitive, simple and linear the story really is. The MC, Sung Jinwoo is a typical generic person in modern day South Korea who happens to have awakened as a \"hunter\" 4 years before the story's beginning. A hunter is a human with enhanced capabilities in fields ranging from agility and strength to the power of using magic and occasionally additional special skills, however, unlike basically everyone, he only gets a miniscule stat boost in strength and regen so useless, people dub him the \"world's weakest hunter\". Why doesn't he just get ... a regular job instead of constanly venturing into dungeons to risk his life? Because it pays well. Now, the MC has plot armor so thick, not even a god could pierce it and that's essentially what happens at the beginning of the story. A monster so powerful not even the strongest of hunters could take it down appears in a supposed low-level dungeon and will serve as the main driving factor for our MC to become stronger until... that motivation is lost in the story and forgotten. He manages to miraculously \"solve\" the monster's attack patterns with pure gut feeling despite having no significant wisdom or intelligence to speak of and sacrifices himself to save the rest of his party, but mysteriously survives, regrows a limb and disintegrates all the monsters inside the dungeon after seeing some strange menu bar while dying and accepting the conditions of becoming a player. When he awakes, he can level up and become stronger which makes him automatically better than everyone else because everyone else just has a set number of stats after awakening. The rest of the story is just the repetition of the first boss battle honestly. Raiding a dungeon, running into a problem like the dungeon being unexpectedly stronger than expected or locking the MC inside of it and the MC fighting an overwhelmingly strong boss to somehow survive and get an upgrade all interlaced with unspeakably thick layers of plot armor, so the MC wouldn't get absolutely obliterated each time he entered a dungeon by the first enemy he encounters. The main cast of characters is pretty much nonexistent outside of some recurring characters and MAYBE 1 support character who doesn't really contribute to the story. As for character development, it seems like there's essentially none either. After the MC becomes a \"player\", he becomes buff and confident in his abilities after levelling up and, having faced death, fearless, however THAT'S IT. After that there's nothing, nada, null, ZERO. 99 chapters in, we have a nonexistent main cast and no character development for the last 96 (?) chapters. A bland self insert is the only thing carrying the story forward and if he were to die, the story would instantly end because all the story is about is Sung Jinwoo levelling up. So what does Solo Leveling offer? Nice visuals and thrilling action (if you try to ignore that the MC absolutely always must overcome his enemies and win in whatever ridiculously showy, dangerous, reckless or life-threatening way possible). Like I said, it's a very simple story that doesn't deliver on the mysteries set up like what a \"player\" is or why there are monsters and dungeons nearly enough and instead lavishes in excessive battles not of wit, but of brute force. The character's rate of improvement is off the charts and after just a few months, the MC is already immeasurably powerful and his power level seems to increase faster and faster as the story progresses, but don't get me wrong, with his overpowered plot armor and his one-of-a-kind ability to level up, he was already the most powerful character in the whole manga from the get-go. These kinds of stories seem to pretty common in Korea and China, but not very enjoyable. I don't want to see a wise sage inside a 0 y/o's body become the wizard lord or whatever at the age of 2 after being tansported back in time or Sung Jinwoo becoming South Korea's strongest hunter in like 2-3 months or something, I wanna see a person grow not only physically, but mentally also, I wanna see interesting plot developments, fascinating characters, an expansive and well-crafted world, elusive mysteries and a kickass ending to tie it all up, I doubt Solo Leveling will ever deliver on any of those things in the future. Now, the overarching elements of Solo Leveling. Vinland Saga has taught us how to properly \"love thy neighbor\", that we aren't born with any enemies, we make them, that chasing revenge can lead you down a dark path and the concept of being \"irredeemable\" and more. Re;Zero revolves around beating the 7 deadly sins with Subaru having to reject his own greed, gluttony, sloth, pride, etc. to grow as a person. When facing adversity, it encourages you to face your problems, not run away from them because it won't fix them. It also says that you can't beat all problems on your own and you should be eager to accept help from others if you're helpless and more. NOW FINALLY, what grand themes does Solo Leveling follow, what lessons does it teach? \"Become stronger to protect the people around you\" - that's literally it. To add salt to the wound, even this theme is half-assed as Sung Jinwoo mostly just enjoys the thrills of almost dying while fighting a powerful enemy, levelling up and getting shiny new items. All-in-all this seems to be another overhyped generic story about a self-insert being badass to make you feel good. Nothing of note, you can safely skip"}, {"score": "7", "content": "Despite the cries claiming this is an unprecedented masterpiece, I've found that while it is a pretty good basic zero-to-hero power fantasy, it's not much beyond that. Story: 6 If you break the series down to its core, it's really all about Jin-Woo (the main character) being an overpowered badass, beating up people/monsters who consistently underestimate him, both literally and figuratively. There really is not much more to it. Overall, it's pretty bland. The video game-like growth-style power system is a fairly popular trope in the Korean web novel scene (which this started out as part of), and the \"monsters assaulting our world through dungeons/gates\" is too. Art: 10 I ... have to give credit where it's due. The art in this series is simply gorgeous. While the backgrounds are a bit bland when they're not strictly necessary, this is made up for by the highly detailed colour(!!) art. I really don't have much more to say on this point. The art is great. Characters: 5 I think the characters in this series is one of its greatest weak points. They are bland, without much purpose apart from highlighting Jin-Woo's good points, which are abundant, seeing as he rather quickly turns into a classic example of a Marty/Gary Stu-type character. The villains are pretty cheap villain-of-the-week types, and I'd be tempted to say the most interesting character in the series is Jin-Woo's friend Yoo Jin-Ho, as he at least has some degree of development. Enjoyment: 8 Despite its flaws, I'm a sucker for this kind of story. The way the series manages to make you giggle over a power up, or over a character's reaction to the main character's badassery over and over again is quite admirable. Overall: 7 While not the masterpice many claim it is, this series is certainly enjoyable. The art makes it pleasing to the eye, and the minor plot points are interesting enough to keep you reading. If you like power fantasies, I'm sure you'll like this. You might however want to stay away if you don't."}, {"score": "4", "content": "This is my first review. Solo leveling is one of the most unenjoyable series and with terrible writing. First let's talk about the main character, I generally hate over powered main characters like jin woo except if their are comedic or like mob. Sure it's cool when he beats them up and shit but that's the same thing as saying some anime is good cause the fights with great animation without any story Character:- which I'm gonna be real is a 1/10, the worst side cast i have seen in all of media. Most of them are non existent and don't get much characterization so I couldn't ... care what happened to them since the series don't want them to shine out. I prefer a strong story but the story itself is boring af cause at the end the main character beats everyone and saves the day. Sure even if I know the ending the ride is what makes the journey also puts it off for me cause he just wins with easy and so far he has never had a tough battle where it would seem like he would loose except when he was growing strong. The story was interesting at first and look promising but now it just fails to make me care with it being more dependent on main characters and not plot. I could go on and on but I have said enough for now..

The artwork is breathtakingly detailed, the action scenes are fluid and dynamic, and the overall level of animation is top-notch. The story itself is a fresh take on the classic trope of a weak protagonist becoming stronger, with unexpected twists and turns that keep readers hooked. But what really sets Solo Leveling apart is the main character's unwavering commitment to improvement through hard work and perseverance. All in all, Solo Leveling is a true masterpiece of ... the genre and a must-read for fans of action-packed manhwa with well-developed characters and captivating artwork."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Solo Leveling / Only I Level Up / 나 혼자만 레벨업 Published: March, 2018 - December, 2021 (main story), Febuary, 2023 (spin-offs) My first ever experience with Solo Leveling was back in 2018, and it's been a long journey these past five years. With the teasers for the upcoming anime adaptation being released, I decided to read the entire story yet again. This is pretty much my first ever review, so bear with me. I also think it's valid to add that I haven't read the novel and my opinion is solely based on the Manhwa adaptation. Story - 5/10 If you look at Solo Leveling's story from ... a more critical point of view, I believe you'll notice two main issues: the clichés and the pacing. Solo Leveling is cliché, and that's not debatable. The weak MC who turns into the strongest being in their universe, the Hunters trope, the ranking system, the dungeons, the \"player\" screen, pretty much all these tropes have been used for years to create hundreds of other stories, even before Solo Leveling's release. However, I think Solo Leveling made good use of these clichés, the author never tried to convince the audience that what he was doing was \"original.\" He knew what the fans wanted to see, and instead of trying to be different, he gave the fans exactly what they wanted, and that made the story ten times better. When it comes to pacing, I think everyone would agree that the ending is rushed. When you read the last 20 chapters of the story, you'll get the feeling that parts of the story are missing. This makes the ending feel less impactful than the rest of the story, since we don't have time to absorb every piece of information that is being thrown at us, which is very unfortunate. Characters - 3/10 Ok, hear me out on this one. It's not that Solo Leveling's characters are bad they're just self-inserts. The MC (Sung Jiwoo) is the most \"developed,\" which is not surprising; however, if you read the story, you'll notice that he has no defining personality traits that make him unique. To be honest, Sung Jiwoo only has an ounce of what you could call \"personality,\" cuz we hear his thoughts all the time. All the other characters are boring, to say the least. We are introduced to the real villains pretty late, so we don't have time to establish a connection with them before they just die. We also barely see the supporting characters cuz we don't have side stories, so we only see them when they're close to the MC, and to be honest Sung Jiwoo's Shadow Army has the best characters cuz they're the only ones who weren't meant to be relatable. If you're familiar with stories that have very complex characters, you'll understand where I'm coming from. World - 8/10 I really enjoy Solo Leveling's world. I like the ranking system and how you can't change your rank unless you \"re-awaken.\" Not only that, but I like how even if you're an S rank, you can't clear an A rank gate alone, so the Hunter's ranking and the Gate's ranking are not equivalent. I really enjoy the monarchs, rulers, and the shadow monarch dynamic. But perhaps the best part is that the entire world is connected (as it should be); Sung Jiwoo is Korean, but we see hunters from all over the world; in fact pretty much all the important events in the story took place outside Korea, It's incredible. Visuals - 8/10 Solo Leveling's art style is amazing; there's no denying it, and there's not much to say either. I'm giving this rating cuz it's a pretty standard art style for this type of manhwa, and it doesn't really add anything original to it. Overall rating - 6/10 Now that the boring stuff is finished, I should probably say that my current opinions on Solo Leveling have changed throughout the years, which is normal. I've been reading it since its release, and I'm a different person than I was five years ago. I can't say to you, \"Read it\" or \"Don't read it,\" cuz it really depends on your tastes and preferences. Maybe you'll like it, or maybe you'll think it's a piece of crap. So for me, you should analyze what you're into and see if it's even worth reading."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I saw a reader say this series isn't comparable to Beserk (not deep enough, not psychological enough) and made similar comparisons to another manga I forgot the name of.

There aren't crazy plot twists, deeper meanings, or even extremely dark undertones. But it is an EXTREMELY satisfying read, especially if you love overpowered characters that basically win every battle despite many onlookers having little faith. One thing Solo Leveling excels in is its character depth. The humans, the hunters, ... and the SHADOWS all took me in hard. I cried a few times - something I didn't expect.

It is addicting, hype, and badass as hell. But it has massive flaws that prevent it from being any more than average. First, let's start with the good aspects of this series. Solo Leveling is entertaining as all hell. The artwork in this series is incredible. It is very stylistic and pleasant to look at. The artwork looks especially godly during the action scenes. Damn those action scenes. They utilize the scrolling format of digital manwha to an incredible extent. This artist NEEDS to do more work because his art was the ... strongest aspect of this series. The series also has very cool character and monster designs as well. In short, the visual aspects of this manwha are incredible. The artwork, character design, world design are all great and the fights are some of the most fluid and dynamic I have seen in a comic. However, Solo Leveling starts to fall apart once you take a closer look at the story and characters. The beginning of the story(first 10 or so chapters) is really strong. It introduces a brutal and terrifying world with a protagonist who seems to be an underdog. However, after the inciting incident, the series goes down a repetitive and boring path. The story of Solo Leveling is somewhat non-existent. There seems to be no specific end goal to the story. It is just the protagonist Sung-Jin Woo leveling up, kicking ass, and being awesome. Jin Woo starts with a solid motivation and character but soon just becomes a badass and handsome hero who never loses. He suffers from extreme Kirito Syndrome albeit he is one of the better OP power fantasy MCs I have seen. His motivations become insignificant halfway through the story, and it is hard to tell what makes him tick as a character other than wanting to level up and become the strongest. Other characters in Solo Leveling exist... And that's about it. The characters are lacking in any depth or complexity outside of basic archetypes and none other than the protagonist contributes to the plot in any way. I can count on one finger the character names I remember other than our hero. Also, none of the side characters win any fights. I mean NO FIGHTS at all. If your name is not Sung-Jin Woo, you might as well be fodder. That all sums up my feelings on Solo Leveling. It is the definition of comfort food in comic book form. It rides entirely on its art, fights, and badassery of the main character to carry it. However, if you are interested in a fun action fantasy series, then I would say Solo Leveling fits the bill."}, {"score": "5", "content": "I honestly will never understand those who rate this 10/10. first off the plot is garbage. at the beginning it seemed good, and i was kinda excited. But then i was incredibly disappointed, i mean the mc becomes ridiculously strong ridiculously fast, never expierinces proper danger, and litterally everything is just used to express how \"badass\" and op he is. the character development is nonexistent. legit the mc is a blank slate. most characters appear for a bit just to show how op mc is or are there to be saved by mc and then they disappear. and the characters that DO stay do ... nothing but wank off the mc. the story is basically just the mc plowing through everything and becoming more op. it gets to the point where the worlds strongest hunters are powerless to some monsters, then mc comes and kills those monsters after a random ass powerup. and if the manhua follows the novel then the story will also have a absolutley shitty ending. the only reason i would read this is for the fight scenes. thanks to the manhuas amazing art the fights are entertaining. basically the only good thing bout solo leveling is watching mindless but cool fights and thats it. no character development, no plot, just mc beating the shit out of eceryone."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Review contain light novel spoilers! I can't believe this manhwa's has a really good rating than TOG or ORV, but in reality for me SL's a decent and boring manhwa with good art adaptation that too overrated and overhyped. *edited bc it seems too offensive Story 4/10: The plot is decent although really easy to expected and lack of plot twist or battle's pattern. The story's just focused to our Gary-stue MC, with his every battle pattern's just Sung Jinwoo (SJW) wants to get stronger- goes to dungeon- the enemies underestimated him- an epic battle with SJW's victory. The story is enjoyable though (especially the Japan's S Dungeon arc, ... it's really reccomended!!), This manhwa more focused to action and battle that SJW went through without any unnecesary harem/fanservice in the middle of story unlike some isekai animes. Spoiler ending LN!!!! But for me the story's really going downhill after Japan's S Dungeon Arc, damn the author's should just stop in that arc smh. After that arc, you would get some filler arc with SJW and Cha Hae In going on a \"date\" and some romantic moments in a really urgent dungeon break time that threaten Seoul territory. Therefore i'm a bit upset with this LN's ending (i get spoilers about the ending), why it should be SJW married with Cha Hae In and having a children. It's really unlogical considering lack of romantic moments between them before (SJW that just focused to battle and strenghen his shadow power and Cha Hae In's one sided love and obsession to his 'smell'). I hope that the manhwa's plot will turn the ending just SJW that enjoys his life with his mom, young sister, and shadows without that unlogical marriage ending. Art 9/10: This manhwa's art is really good, the battle, color, and shade is really good. Honestly, it's maybe the reason why this manhwa is so popular. And, it's inevitable that SJW's handsome face and braveness bring more plus point to read this manhwa. Character 1/10: It's a really pathetic character development that i've ever read. It's not about Jinwoo, he has decent personality (an emo and lack of emotions that every generic isekai mc have) . But, another character except him is just extras that just allowed to see our MC's amazingness. They're not have any distinct personality, if they have any in the later they will get nerf-character that will be a coward and dependent individual that always hope SJW will help them anytime. Damn, even the Country Hunter (or whatever it's name) like Thomas Andre that was a prideful and strong will character will get depended and get nerfed when Jinwoo makes entrance before him. Enjoyment 6/10: This story is enjoyable if you just want an easy story with action focused plot that has OP killing machine MC. And this is really a resfreshment for me that searched a good action-fantasy comic that just focused to battle without helping some harem girls and developed romance subplot with either of those girls. But it's really, REALLY NOT recommended if you want a heavy plot with good character developments. Overall 5/10: Anyway, this story is a decent and boring plot with edgy killing machine of a MC that luckily has a good art and nice battle-drawing. It's really not reccomended to read this if you want a good development plot story. *sorry for any grammar mistakes."}, {"score": "9", "content": "ok so keep in mind i am a fan of those power trip fantasy manhwas so if that is something you dislike then we will likely have some disagreement in opinion also i happen to be of the exact same opinion about solo leveling as a certain youtuber by the name of Yiman, so if you have watched his videos and disagree (or agree for that matter), no need to continue reading overall i liked it a lot there were points when i was not sure about it, since the fights kind of lost suspense up until a certain point, and the mc seemed to have no emotions at all what ... so ever. but then, all of a sudden its like the writer got replaced or he hit his head and had a sudden change in personality the main character was originally kind of dynamic since he went from weakest to strongest but then he kind of stagnated for a while, until the point i mentioned above and he started having those smiling kuudere moments and the battles got unboring again overall the art was pretty good and the other parts were good, so i will say this is not the image of perfection some fans were saying it was, but it also wasn't the hot garbage the people who hate it were saying it was."}, {"score": "5", "content": "\"This isn't solo leveling anymore!\" - Solo Leveling, chapter 46 Ah yes, the highly praised webtoon, Solo Leveling. Now that it started being released physically too, it's finally added to MALs database. Does it live up to expectations? Not really, no. Note that this review contains slight spoilers. Solo Leveling is pretty much your typical \"zero to hero\" story, despite what fans might claim. Protagonist is weak, encounters trouble and is handed down some op abilities out of nowhere. Yes, he technically has to do quest to earn progress, but just the ability to do quests itself is unique to the world and is given to the protagonist as ... a complete freebie. This \"underdog\" is now stronger than almost everyone else, yet still has tendency to try to hide his abilities, for no apparent reason. I guess him being shown as strong all the time would hinder self-insertion. The story is fine, more or less what you would expect from the genre, not great, not terrible. It's still a fun read, don't get me wrong, but it's hardly something I would call great. The greatest weakness is the repetitiveness. All the arcs after the first one go like this: MC enters a dungeon, something \"unsusual\" and \"unexpected\" happens, the expected difficulty increases, everything looks dire and unbeatable, MC starts doing stuff, the threat turns to be irrelevant as MC triumps over it relatively easily. More and more easily with each arc. As the story progresses, I kept losing motivation to read more of it. What was faulty but at least a bit entertaining comic at start more and more degenerated towards mediocrity. And you can only get so far with good art alone. The stakes are all gone a there is no way the protagonist would lose, and the protagonist is no longer interesting, therefore you just don’t care what happens. There is just no thrill anymore. Which is why the first few chapters were the best. You were worried about the protagonist as there was no telling whether he'll make it out alive. After that, there is no real point to the story anymore, it’s just a continuous effortless massacre of obstacles. The MC himself went from likeable underdog that works hard despite being the weakest to help his ill mother to not really giving a heck and having no problem straight out murdering someone. And this substory about ill mother? You would expect that to get attention right after the protagonist gets strong and loaded, right? Nah, it doesn't get mentioned until much later when the author remembers that they made this substory in attempt to make the MC more likeable. That said, with later chapters, the story does actually go back to the \"mother is ill\" part of the plot. It is thanks to a bunch of random item drops that conjured the potion of plotforwarding, sure, but that's still better than nothing. A positive point for you, Solo Leveling. On that note, I also do appreciate the story going back to the beginning to explain it a bit more, I did not expect it would remember it should do so. It was one of the few points in later half of Solo Leveling that interested me at least a bit, as it also went a bit back to the original solo-levelingness. My complaint also used to be that the origin of system of protagonist’s powers wasn’t explained at all, so I’m glad that did get sorted out. Unfortunately the story did a Naruto move with “the loser protagonist was the chosen one all the time”, so that knocks down the quality back. With the changes to MC follow \"edgy spikes\". I'm not that fond of using the \"edgy\" buzzword in a review, but in this case it fits as the description perfectly. From time to time the edginess spikes out of nowhere, probably in an attempt to make the comic more interesting, but the result is exactly opposite. This is getting more obnoxious as the story progresses further. One of the peaks of the terrible parts of Solo Leveling is the ants arc. Sounds familiar? Yep, it quite is a HxH rip-off. Badly made one. The writing is terrible. The arc can be summed up as presentation of the the strongest characters the Hunter Association has to offer only for all of them to be beaten easily so the protagonist can waltz in and save the day effortlessly like the Gary Stu he is, takes a souvenir corpse to summon another overpowered servant and that's the arc done. This part really cemented the story of Solo Leveling as nothing more than bad power fantasy with good art. As the story progresses, I kept losing motivation to read more of it. What was faulty but at least a bit entertaining comic at start more and more degenerated towards mediocrity. And you can only get so far with good art alone. The stakes are all gone a there is no way the protagonist would lose, and the protagonist is no longer interesting, therefore you just don’t care what happens. The best part of Solo Leveling is undoubtedly art. It's full colored, atmospheric, and the action is well drawn. On the other hand, it's not that's much different from most of webtoons of similar genres. Overall, Solo Leveling is an okay read, but certainly nothing revolutionary. The more webtoons you’ll read, the less interesting this is. That said, this is the first webtoon for many."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Solo Leveling is a junk food, delicious but no nutritional value The story follows our main hero, Sung Jin-Woo, as he lives out the zero-to-hero trope, going from the weakest at his job of Hunter to the strongest Hunter ever seen (that's not a spoiler, just the premise of the manhwa). Hunters are how this world calls people who \"awaken\", receiving powers beyond any normal human. Even the weakest Hunters are physically more powerful than any human could be. That's because the enemies they face are not regular humans, but monsters that appear inside \"gates\", portals leading to different dungeons and mini-worlds where a group of ... monsters of different types lives in, having a boss that needs to be defeated to close the Gate. That is by itself a pretty basic premise, many times done before, with minor differences but the same overall structure. Monsters attack, they have ranks of power, a \"hero\" or \"monster hunter\" association arises and people take on killing monsters as a profession. One Punch Man did it masterfully with its satirical take on the over-saturated super-hero genre. So did Pacific Rim, taking on the Mecha genre, and with a much more serious, although not less badass presentation. Just from these two examples, you can see that the base upon which Solo Leveling is built is not the most ground-breaking one, even having a direct reference to Saitama's training routine built into it. Which is okay, to be fair. You don't need to create a new narrative setting every time you want to tell a story. The problem comes after you read 10, 20, 50, 100 chapters of it and realize that... It's just like any other fighting shounen gamer power fantasy with super-heroes ever made. Narratively, it does not create anything that would make it stand above its peers, or even stand out from them. It blends in, silently, with not a notch of uniqueness attached to it. Why, then, has it gained such popularity? The art. It's because of the art. Solo Leveling is a studio produced manhwa based on an already written novel. Being drawn by a bunch of talented artists, inked by another bunch, colored by another and lettered by yet another, it comes as no surprise that the thing looks amazing, even releasing on a weekly basis. Which only serves to make the critical failures in it's writing seem worse. The character designs, the monster designs specially, the background art, the dungeons, the fighting choreography and flow, the framing, basically everything that makes this a great read, are all just surface level, a beautiful skin covering a decaying, poorly written, poorly paced story full of tropes and clichés, and characters so forgettable I could not tell you the name of a single one of them without pulling up google first. Since the art is universally praised and known, I will not critique it. Instead, lets dissect the real bad shit below it, starting by the least outrageous flaw, the pacing. The pacing in this thing is a mess. It goes extremely fast in certain aspects, and sluggishly slow on others. The power scaling is outright broken. You go so quickly from a weak good for nothing guy to a baddass that it becomes numbing. The last actual tough fight is around chapter 40, and from there, you have just firework shows and long lasting fights that look good to make up for how easy and unchallenging they feel, so much so that they start feeling boring after some time, namely once he gets so many powerful shadow servants he himself barely has to fight. He is basically already a demigod half-way through season one. Any challenge, any tension that would make the fights feel much more intense and compelling, those things are gone. It's just a matter of how long will he take to beat them?\" instead of \"how will he beat them?\" or even \"can he beat them?\". The fights feel dumb-down and even tiresome in the later chapters, and no amount of badassery from the MC can save them. At the same time, the pacing of the story is abysmally slow, contrasting heavily with the break-neck pace of the power scaling. The story presents all those threads, but follows on none of them. There isn't a scent of an over-arching plot, and it just feels like the author is throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks. It feels sluggish, messy and chaotic, like it knows it has to move, but just keeps changing lanes and running around in circles. The story finally progresses a bit in the end of season one, but by that time, just about 7 possible paths were opened, and not one of them was closed. The super powerful hunter that came from america to face Jin-Woo? Just left. His father coming out of a dungeon after over a decade? He is there, somewhere. The system that gives Jin-Woo his powers? whatever, never explained. The hell dimension that overlaps with Seoul? Takes you nowhere and is solved in less than 10 chapters, leaving that big dull feeling of having created hype for nothing. The ant infestation on the island is solved, but just serves a finale to show off cool fights, and has nothing at all to do with any previous plot. If you have a bad pacing, that's okay. Maybe the story really makes up for it when it picks up! But what if your story is not that interesting and does nothing to pay-off any slow build-ups? Well, at least you can have interesting characters there, so the reader doesn't get bored right? Pull them in with a little investment. I'm sorry to say, but Solo Leveling's most grave failure is exactly that - the characters are so uninteresting it hurts. Not only are they painfully forgettable, bland and uninteresting, some are just bad written characters. Not a single one of them has a believable motivation, engaging backstory or captivating personality. They are 2D cardboard cut-outs of generic anime tropes. The cute healer, the clumsy rich kid, the OP bad guy, the wise master, the annoying stubborn teenager, the little sister, the sick mom, the missing dad, the semi-badass love interest, so on, so on. Just from making this list, I could think of two or more other characters from other animes that fit the bill for each one of those. I will not care to search for any names besides the MC because they don't deserve my 10 seconds of googling. You could just swap each one of them for any other generic anime character and not lose anything at all. You don't care about their struggles, you don't care about their lives, and so any tension a fight could have is completely gone, since them living or dying wouldn't matter anyway (not that they even die, since the MC just always saves them last minute). So when you get a Main Character that is just boring edgy isekai trash, secondary characters so bland a smooth white wall has more personality than them, a plot so broken and disrupted that you don't even know where the story is going (and it really isn't going anywhere), what else can you say but that this Manhwa is just looks, no substance? The writing is atrociously boring, uninteresting and generic, the fights look good, but they don't feel good because the illusion that the MC could lose is not there. The tension is not there. You don't have a reason to care about these fights, you don't have a motivation to like the characters, or dislike the antagonists, or even care at all about the MC getting stronger. It's like a pasture of fake grass. Looks good, but feels awful. In conclusion, Solo Leveling had a chance at being a great fighting Manhwa, with such a good art and fights, and a world open enough to add any interesting plot the author could want. But it follows up on nothing, resolves poorly and just feels dry of any real emotion, power, punch or hype it could have. It is generic shounen trash, and should be remembered as such in the future, unless it brings a major shift in direction and actually follows up on the paths it sets for itself. And I mean a really big change. Otherwise, I don't see any reason for it to keep existing at all."}, {"score": "9", "content": "It’s rare to find stories where the main character does everything alone—so when I first watched the anime adaptation of Solo Leveling, I was immediately hooked. The idea that Sung Jin-Woo didn’t need a party to fight monsters felt surprisingly inspiring. That independence, both in his battles and growth, really stood out. When I went to read the manhwa, I was even more impressed by the striking artwork, character designs, and the way the story was presented. Normally, I’m not a fan of overpowered protagonists or power fantasies—often they make stories feel redundant and devoid of tension. But Solo Leveling manages to handle Sung Jin-Woo’s rise ... in a way that keeps things exciting. His powers develop logically and with purpose, and the series continually introduces new threats and twists that keep the stakes high and the story gripping. The fights are epic, and the pacing rarely drags. The first thing that came to mind while reading was Dark Souls. The visual tone, the gloomy dungeons, the mysterious environments, and the game-like mechanics all felt inspired by that franchise. You can clearly see the influence of video games, and even some elements reminiscent of Hunter x Hunter (especially a certain arc, which fans will recognize). I genuinely don’t understand the hate this manhwa gets. Yes, the main character becomes incredibly powerful—and that can be a turn-off for some—but it’s well justified within the story and doesn’t feel lazy or unearned. The world-building and internal politics are surprisingly solid. While the side characters aren’t deeply developed, they serve their purpose well. This is, after all, his solo journey, and the title delivers exactly what it promises. If you go in expecting complex team dynamics, romance, or traditional rivalries, you might be disappointed. But if you’re looking for a thrilling urban fantasy about a young man fighting his way to the top—slaying dragons, orcs, elves, and more—you’ll be in for a treat."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I don't ever write any reviews so this much should tell you how much I like Solo Leveling. Whoever tells you this isn't a 10/10 manhwa in its genre is simply lying to you or themselves.

It is an absolute joy to follow the story and I think it gets better with every chapter. Not going to waste more of your time which you should be spending reading the manhwa instead of its silly little review; so go on then, try it out already!"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Solo Leveling is hands down one of the best masterpieces you will ever come across. Constantly filled with cliffhangers and intense moments it will not disappoint. Not to mention, that this is the almost complete opposite of One Punch Man where the concept of an OP Main Character becomes repetitive (despite liking One Punch Man personally, its hard to disagree). Story - 10/10 In terms of the idea of the story, it is pretty generic. But the way Solo Leveling turns such a generic idea into such a masterpiece is what gives this rating. Initially, it isn't as easy to grab onto the concept but as ... you read more chapters you will slowly become addicted to the story. Art - 10/10 Undoubtedly one of the best styles of artwork I've seen not only in manga/manhwa but also in anime, the fact that it has colour adds so much to it. Once you've seen the artwork you'll be dying to see how it turns out when it eventually gets animated Character - 8/10 The only reason this category has a mere 8 (which is still amazing but pales in comparison to the others) is that in my opinion more characters need to have some form of backstory specially towards the end. I would mention character development but in most cases as the plot implies no one can increase powers. Enjoyment - 10/10 This masterpiece of a manhwa is one of the few things that kept me going through the week knowing a chapter would be released.

Before that i would like to mention that the content has spoilers and you should read at your own risk . : ) Read many webtoons , Manhwa , Manhua and manga so far . Typically all of them have some stuff that are clichéd . But that literally is based on their definition on what u call cliché . Japanese manga's with their old dense and stupid MC . chinese with their cultivation and Koreans with the game console etc etc . But the real thing is particularly Solo leveling is the best webtoon i read so far . Maybe ... I will give you a few better reasons to call it a masterpiece . The manga currently has 96 chaps ongoing as far as I'm reading already completed the novel and based on that i can say THE AUTHOR DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THE STORY . so those who didn't read the Novel shouldn't make a complete assumption on the webtoon so far . Our Main character started from nothing and is currently something due to the weird system he got accustomed with from the double dungeon . The origin of this system is still unknown and many people question about how pathetic this is that they didn't give the origin . I tell them to hold on to your horses cause the explanation is coming in the future chapters .As I said earlier they didn't even touch the story . so far the MC was just leveling up aling with the system and all . here is where the spoiler starts After the current jeju Island arc the MC will be called into the double dungeon once again and i tell you something that the mystery will finally unfold after that moment . at least half of it . at least you get to read some badass moments of the typical OP MC till that part comes in. So , I assure you people that those who search for story should be patient and read this thing . Literally the MC seems strong in the latest chapters so far and trust me he was never weak . But the upcoming fights don't get too easy which is one of the specialties of the story . In most Korean stuff i see the countless wining streak of the MC . And i'm like .... why do u even need an antagonist to begin with ??? But Solo leveling went different in this case showing some shounen vibes in it . The character development in this manga and even in the novel is quite lacking if you ask me . cause the story is completely focused on the MC . characters jump out of nowhere without much of a significant background.Most stuff don't add up if you do that tbh . But I choose to ignore the fact . At least they give us some little 2 to 3 line introduction . As I say every manga needs an ART and seriously the art of this manga is off the charts . ig u don't need the dialogues in it if u consider the dynamic art . and the MC doesn't talk much in the first place . In the END if you are still reading this rubbish .......... JUST GO AND READ THE MANGA."}, {"score": "7", "content": "Solo leveling was a pretty entertaining and fun read for the first 100 chapters before the main character became an isekai protagonist. The first 50 chapters were a good 8, then the next an average 7, and now it lays at a low 6, the show falling to purely generic instances. Now don't get me wrong, I still read the weekly chapters, but not with the intensity as the previous ones. I'll admit I was considering putting the first season as one of my favorites, as trashy as that is, but the second season was like milking a dead cow and squeezing out content, without ... the vibrancy or the quality of the first season. *Season One (Chapters 1-110) With probably one of the most intense beginnings in all of Manga, my thoughts can only immediately go to the story of Solo Leveling. Known worldwide as the “World's weakest hunter”, we follow the tale of the Korean 22 year old and how his life changes. Choosing to become a hunter as a job, he gets the rank of E, and has no powers. However he still goes into gates, portals that open up across the world where monsters reside and dominate, where when the boss is defeated the gate closes. After being left in a particularly dangerous dungeon for dead, with 18 dying before him, an alert box appears in his vision 0.02 seconds before he dies, welcoming him to something mysteriously titled “The system”, saying that he fulfilled the requirements to become a “player”. Call it a generic twist I can agree, but the execution is what makes the manga. We follow the newly re-awakened hunter Sung Jin Woo evolve and grow. Where it is literally impossible for hunters to get stronger, Solo Leveling tells the tale of the one hunter who could get stronger, and all the repercussions that happen because of that allowing for some insane fights and amazing art. One of the things I really liked about the first 100 chapters was the world created. So many Manhwa and power fantasy stories have these generic fantasy worlds, focusing on making the main character stronger, and forgetting all other aspects of the world. However, the Solo Leveling took time to slowly integrate the world, dungeons, and gates throughout the story. Unlike many of these other stories that throw all the information at the beginning and never mention it again, the story gives you just enough in the beginning to make you understand and let you go in blind. The 10 chapter greatness that was the first arc was the perfect setup. It introduced so many things along the way while still having minimal conversation using the first arc's fights and circumstances to make it a riveting introduction to the world. It built a world similar to ours that depends on these gates and these hunters, slowly integrating piece and piece of information that creates these instances and the place around the MC. It sets up lots of chapters in advance, the world functions as a world, and things build up and set in play that only gets explored after two or three arcs. We learn about the various types of hunters, gates, and organizations, hunter or not. The Gates were also fantastic, each a different environment and new horizons to be explored. Despite being portals to magical worlds, they were all different missions that somehow explored more of their world and power systems, providing all of those and some sick fights. They were pseudo \"missions\" to other worlds and one thing you look forward to in the beginning chapters. The world was fascinating, new things popping up each arc, and was only part of the greatness that was Solo Leveling’s first season. The story also paid careful attention to its power system and characters. While at first, it was the generic \"Leveling\" power system that you could attribute to many games or isekai, it paid careful attention to the system and added certain attributes, certain kinks, and certain powers that made it the story's focus. The mysteries of the system were slowly unraveled, and the abilities grounded. It became a fully fleshed out power system that had both good and bad, the MC using it actually in a smart way, the way we would. There were some references to other works and sparks of genius, the main character taking advantage of the system, and not the other way around. And while it was the generic \"level up\" power system, it wasn't used because it was easy to write in but to explore the world and the hunters' powers. The idea of having the Hunters start with a set amount of power and never have it change was great. Just about every show with “powers” allows their participants to get stronger, but it was a great shift on the system where you had the main character with this leveling power, compared to the world where people could not level up. With all the information they added for the power system, we received a complete power system that seemed pretty straightforward but complex enough to match the greats. Same with the characters. While it was more apparent in the first 50 chapters, the characters were actual characters, not the peanut gallery that hyped up villains in the most generic way possible. Characters had unique and fun designs that fit their personalities, and there were no oversexualized characters. The show had various characters ranging from ones with small arcs, purely strong ones, unique personalities, and even waifus. They were all little pieces of the world that told specific stories and helped build up the world and the story in general. They would each represent certain aspects of the world, from the poor hunters to the wealthy hunters, to the crazy hunters to all the thousands of different hunter classes. And while the story soon shifted to have more characters with less screen time focusing on the A and S rank hunters, they still were enjoyable as they acted like a family and rivals. The shadows(will be explained later in the webtoon) were also enjoyable despite having no diagoulge. Amazingly, their emotions and personalities were conveyed purely through still images, and I wouldn't say no to having a chapter that is just the shadows interacting. Before I finish the first season, two more things: the main character and the art, the main reasons people read Solo Leveling. The art in Solo Leveling is some of the best ever made. Usually, I prefer black and white Manga, as art looks better there. Many movement blurs, movement lines in the background, and starburst that symbolize hitting, are left out in the colored versions, looking out of place there. These colored comics usually look like still pictures, with the majority of the colored ones making me wish it was in black and white with uneven coloring, shading, and bad fight art. However, none of these complaints apply to Solo leveling. If Vinland Saga's Manga is the king of black and white art, Solo levelings Color is the king of all colored art. Period. While it does start a bit \"meh\" in the first 30 chapters, it gets so good after that. The fights here are also phenomenal on par with the taijutsu you see in Naruto. Technical to a fault, it's not about who can make the bigger explosion, but how to outsmart and beat your opponents, each character showcasing different and colorful abilities. In the first half, the main character is still the weakest hunter, and he is forced to utilize almost every skill he has, making some fantastic fights and pay-offs that make you sigh in relief or terror. Each fight will leave you on the edge of your seat, the hype constantly increasing the moments that blow your mind. This is one of the few works(Like Vinland Saga) where I only will read the Manga, the art never able to be fully replicated in an animation, Madhouse, Ufotable, or not. The main character also had a good development as he acclimated to his surroundings and became a top tier chad. While he didn't have a character arc on the level as the best characters in anime/manga, it did exceptionally well for the series it was in and made you root for him. His humble beginnings make you feel nostalgic as he almost grew up. You easily rooted for him, and he changed from the not so confident isekai protag to a more edgy refined man. Now \"character development\" is probably an overstatement, as all he did is become an edgy badass, but in the series favor, it did fit the change. However, it was this change into a cool older character where the story begins to crumble apart. *Season two(Chapter 111 and beyond) Spoilers for Season One and Season two are here, even as vague I describe them. I suggest you read some of the chapters of the story before reading this segment. But here is a spoiler-free 10-word version: Too overpowered, no tension, mysteries bad, characters bad/gone, isekai tier. Disregarding the epic and hype-filled finale of the last season, the story begins to break apart from here, the small cracks in the first season now more prominent and more evident in the second. The story seems to forget what made the first season so great, and it wasn't an overpowered character one shot every monster. It was when he surpassed his limits, the moments where he made a new discovery, where there was a twist in the gate where the characters had their moments, and where his powers had personalities and were fun to watch. The second season disregarded those factors and decided to power up the main character so that he could beat Goku. To be fair, the series tries to shed light on how the mysteries and unsolved cases that the first one does and the first 15 chapters were pretty okay. It gave some good buildup, good fights, and decent answers, however after \"The Architect,\" it then began to fall. Cool reveal, but a lousy way of resolving the issue. Despite being only a \"Player\" of \"The System,\" he somehow overrules the creator and comes out unscathed. The world stops revolving around the sun and revolves around him, as every event has to do with him. While there are still those pieces of information strewn across some chapters and the scenarios different, it doesn't capture the charm as it focuses purely on the fights, ignoring everything else. While the author continued with less information there, the artist didn't allow it, focusing only on the battles that lose their creativity. Devolving into who can make the bigger explosion or one-shotting the villain, it quickly became hard to enjoy the fights now gone. While I try not to criticize a series due to its art, I have to when it's the main thing it's enjoyed for. The fights lose most of the choreography as Sung Jin Woo is just on a different level to his opponents, and he always soloes the bosses in two seconds. Because of this, tension now rarely appears, as I know that whatever Sung Jin-Woo encounters will be defeated with no problems. Now the series has become smart with handling that, as it targets other people, but the antagonists are usually always beaten as he arrives, which is always before important people die. The characters aside from Sung JIn woo, Beru, and Igris are forgotten, holding no character in their scenes. The series seems to forget about characters and their roles, focusing purely on Sung Jin-Woo, which doesn't work anymore. His screen time seems boring, edgy in the Manga, being equivalent to having no personality. He had no room left to grow that feels genuine anymore, as it jumps and does power boosts happening too quickly. His vibrant personality disappears, and choosing to be a one-man army allows for no characters to fill in the void. In season two, many chapters of the Manga entail him talking to himself, which with his now bland personality make them hard to read. There has yet to be a single character from the last season who had adequate screen time that was on the same level as last time. In conclusion, Solo Leveling was a fun and interesting manga that was a self-fulfillment power fantasy that first coated itself with a great world, writing, and characters. However, as time went by, the paint wore off, and we received a hype but shallow webtoon that stand on the face of webtoons, but nowhere near the top 12 manga. While the second season wasn't as enjoyable as the first, it still did the job well, and if you have time to binge a manga, this should be the first one on your list. Story: 7.5/10 Art 10/10 Character: 6.7 /10 Enjoyment 9/10 Overall 8/10"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Story: 9/10 Solo Leveling most definitely gave OP MC's a one up. It is a genre that many animes, manga and WebToons have done decently well. Solo Leveling really does do the OP MC genre well. The character development of Jin Woo was outstanding because it really brought out the satisfaction that the audience wanted to see. It is a fast paced story that is surprisingly easy to keep up with. The only flaw was that there were barely any other stories and the only focus of the story was Jin Woo. It is a good thing however, that Jin Woo did have many moments ... to himself to compensate for the lack of other story arcs. Art: 10/10 I am a big fan of WebToon art styles and Solo Leveling had consistent clean art throughout the whole series. The lines were polished and thick. The colors were also bright and contrasted. The dungeons were slightly dark, however that made a cool effect with Jin Woo's signature glowing eyes. Both bright and dark parts were amazing. Character design were also classic WebToon which I also love. All in all 10/10. Character: 10/10 Jin Woo was the main character of this WebToon. They placed large amounts of emphasis on his growth as a person and character. The powers he gains and the respect he gains from other characters really made him grow into the OP MC we have. Other characters were relevant enough to support Jin Woo's growth and that was enough to place the focus mainly on Jin Woo and keep us captivated on his character. Enjoyment: 9/10 Seeing an OP MC grow is by far one of the most satisfying things in this type of entertainment. Solo Leveling definitely fulfilled my hunger on that aspect and it really did well. I loved the fact that they planned this story for 2 years and gave it a satisfying and cool environment to enjoy. I just wished there had been a little more female action going on there. Otherwise everything I enjoyed fully. Overall: 9/10 Like I said, I enjoy this type of story greatly. I am satisfied with each battle and each level up. Each time an antagonist's ass gets whooped by Jin Woo. Proving someone wrong is a great feeling and Solo Leveling provides us that feeling. The feeling of having the ability to prove someone wrong and become more powerful. The overarching mystery of how he gained his powers as well as the gates becomes the mystery for another day. The day when Jin Woo becomes even more than he already is."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Solo Leveling stands out as one of the best, if not the absolute best, manhwa I have had the pleasure of reading during my three years immersed in the world of manhwas. The storyline is captivating, the artwork is stunning, and the character development is unparalleled. Each chapter leaves me eagerly anticipating the next, and the journey of the protagonist, Jinwoo, is both thrilling and inspiring. The blend of action, fantasy, and emotional depth makes Solo Leveling a truly exceptional read that has set a high bar for all other manhwas I explore. The story of Solo Leveling is unique in many aspects, especially in its ... world-building and the leveling system of the protagonist, Jinwoo. While some elements might be familiar to fans of the genre, the execution and progression of the story set it apart. Even when certain plot points were predictable, I found myself enjoying it immensely because the narrative is engaging and the genre, which blends action and fantasy with RPG elements, is one I particularly enjoy. Absolutely, the art style of Solo Leveling is perfectly fitting for the story. The detailed and dynamic illustrations bring the action scenes to life and enhance the overall reading experience. The vibrant colors and meticulous designs of characters and settings help immerse readers in the manhwa's world, making the intense battles and emotional moments all the more impactful. For the most part, the characters in Solo Leveling react to situations in realistic ways, considering the fantastical context of the story. Jinwoo’s responses to challenges, his strategic thinking, and his emotional reactions are well-grounded and believable. Supporting characters also show a range of reactions that add to the authenticity of the narrative, even in the midst of extraordinary circumstances. I believe many others will enjoy Solo Leveling, even if they are not typically fans of the genre. The series has a broad appeal due to its compelling storyline, stunning artwork, and well-developed characters. However, those who prefer more realistic or non-fantasy genres might not find it as appealing. The intense focus on leveling up and battles might also be less engaging for readers who look for more varied plotlines. Nonetheless, the quality of the storytelling and art makes it a strong contender for a wide readership."}, {"score": "5", "content": "\"Average\" is exactly the word to describe the feeling of reading Solo Leveling. As much as it's fun to read some parts, a lot of things ended up annoying me and that took off most of the excitement of every new chapter. Here I will try to briefly say some positives and negatives of this story so far. Hope it will be helpful. The first few chapters start up really good. We're introduced to a character struggling to survive as a hunter, a professional that raids portals filled with monster that appear randomly in the world, despite being one of the weakest in in his rank, ... that's also the lowest. Sung Jin-Woo's problems and fears feel very real and it's easy to sympathize with him, until a certain incident happens while in a mission inside a portal. After the incident, Jin-Woo receives a unique power never seen before in his world and things go pretty much downhill from there. The personality he had is slowly lost while he becomes more and more powerful, falling into the very old trope of \"mysterious gloomy character that somehow everyone likes, specially at least 3 girls that have a crush on him\". In the latest chapters Jin-Woo doesn't even break a sweat in the challenges he faces, and while it's exciting seeing how powerful he is, it takes a lot of the thrill of the fights. He met his original goal and his other smaller objectives are easy to deal with, he doesn't need to fight to survive anymore and is strong enough to defeat enemies with ease, so what *is* the point of the story? I ended up being more interested in secondary characters like Baek Yoon-Ho, Min Byung-Gyu and Choi Jong-In, who had different views and personalities, and that's what truly kept me curious about where all of this is going. Specially in the last chapters the author introduced us to a lot of interesting characters with great designs that intrigued me quite a bit, but in the end neither them nor the main character are really explored well so it's kinda disappointing. Specially with Sung Jin-Woo as he has a lot of opportunities to grow and change psychologically because of all the risks and problems he had to face. Ultimately nothing of this happens and we just have a shallow main character and even shallower secondary ones. The worldbuilding is ordinary, with some engaging notions but nothing too impressive. As for the plot, whilst having some really cool original concepts that weren't really explored in anime in general, at a lot of occasions I caught myself thinking \"wait, I'm sure I've seen this somewhere before\" with a lot of events in the story, which was kind of boring sometimes. Of course, nowadays it's pretty difficult to come up with a totally original concept and really, that's okay! Because what truly makes a story fresh and captivating is the narrative: the way the author shows the information and makes us think. And that's something that also disappointed me a bit with Solo Leveling. Important information being shown only at convenient times, a lot of relevant characters appearing in the span of a few chapters that we end up forgetting about shortly after and some really, really poor attempts at plot twists. It's not terrible writing, but so average that these small things make us notice other frustrating parts, specially the same overused tropes of basically every fantasy manga/anime ever. All in all, it's actually not so bad. I enjoyed a lot of characters and moments, was awed by the eye catching art, but as time passed it became just really bland and forgettable. As each chapter is released I notice more and more the tons of clichés and questionable narrative and this just tosses in the trash all the emotions I initially felt with the story. It's a good webcomic (now manga I guess) for those who don't really care for plot details as much as I do and enjoy really cool fighting scenes, but at the same time I think some parts could have been done differently and maybe better than it is."}, {"score": "5", "content": "It had a pretty good beginning, but after the first 20ish chapters it just becomes too predictable, too over the top, too shallow.

If it was like 50-60chapters AND completed I'd say sure, give it a read if your looking for something on a rainy day. But its at 150 and its still ONGOING, like dude no.

The art is spectacular and although the concept of the story isn't original it has been done so well that you don't feel the similarities. However as i read each i began to realize that the story is just the same arc being recycled and while this can be said about many shonen or shonenesque manga i find this to be particularly monotonous. Every \"Arc\" involves a the MC meeting a new character that takes an interest in him, he hides ... his abilities from them only for the a situation to occur that forces him to reveal his true strength. this cycle could be interesting, unfortunately the author makes no effort to make the MC interesting at all. he has few personal goals and those he does have are resolved with laughable ease. His power scales much faster than that of the enemies he faces so no fight feels tense because not only do you know hes going to win but he wont break a sweat doing it. Despite that once i realized that was the case i was able to keep reading with no problem because who really thinks Gon, Naruto, or Goku is going to lose? you read it to see the amazing visuals, the great fight scenes, and the character conflicts if you can get invested in them."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Story If you start from chapter 0. You will get an idea of this manga it contains some spoilers but its kinda like a trailer. The story revolves around the MC Sung Jin-Woo a hunter of the lowest rank who would easily get hurt from the weakest monsters or even a scratch given a second chance by the system to gain the power to get stronger but at a slow pace. It started out as a simple concept but it gets darker and deeper as the MC discovers something about the system in his adventure. Art The art is sick. By the time you reach the necromancer chapter the ... art goes from good to mind blowing. The art showing the fight scenes is so clean and since its in colour you'll never get confused of the fight scenes. The characters design are simple yet there's something about them that stand out making them unique in a way. Characters Sung jin-woo our MC stands out the most and his character design could not have been better. Jin Ho which is kinda like MC's younger brother makes the atmosphere light. He's a funny character and you'll love him. There are some mysterious characters which makes it interesting, characters like MC's father the national level hunters. And some characters from the other side which are mysterious. Enjoyment It's really exciting to see the development of the character or how the raid will go, will it turn into a red gate. Overall this Manhwa is Amazing and you should probably start reading it!"}, {"score": "8", "content": "\"Arise\" Solo Levelling; TLDR : Weak man become strong man. Baddies go brr. Most of these reviews are pretty old so this one should give a little more perspective into what you need considering I've just caught up. Story: 7/10 Story-wise it's got an interesting blend of the usual MC being super weak and then goes on to become insanely powerful. EXCEPT, here it all happens almost instantly and there is no build up to it. So the reader is quite unprepared when it happens, which wasn't a bad thing because they pulled it off quite well. This also ends up adding to the 'just how strong is Sung ... Jin-Woo now?' factor which you will come to realize is a recurring theme in the story. The story also dabbles fairly well in the aspect of being in a game or simulation of sorts. While the storyline isn't very unique per se, it does it's job well and that is probably why it is selling as much as it is. Stays true to the fantasy and action/adventure genre very rarely straying away (almost never). Art: 9/10 This is a Manhwa and not a traditional Manga so don't dive into it expecting the usual. I must say it was quite a refreshing change to see everything in colour as it added a lot more depth and flavour to the characters and the fight scenes. There are a lot of panels with extremely detailed and elaborate artwork which you'd find yourself pausing in awe and just to take it all in. You might be a bit confused at first; might even hate it. But stick around, I promise it's worth getting used to. Character: 4/10 Right. Here's where it takes quite a hit. The characters apart from the MC just feel very bland. The story devotes 90% focus on the MC and everyone else just feel like they really don't have much consequence to anything at all. Character development apart from Jin-Woo getting stronger is pretty pathetic to say the least. They should've invested a bit more in this area so the readers aren't just getting to see a one-dimensional progression character-wise. The support characters show up sparsely during the series and that makes it difficult to predict how they would react in various scenarios. A change in any character felt sudden and almost forced in an attempt to steer the story in a particular direction. It definitely could've been handled better by simply giving a few more chapters to allow more details to really sink in. Enjoyment: 9/10 There's no doubt about this. It may not be revolutionary but it's surely worth every minute of the read. Never gets old watching Jin-Woo absolutely sh*t on the baddies and make them feel like peasants when he shows up. Never a dull moment as we're always looking at the next big build up to a fight so you'll find yourself reading for hours on end. \"Hero comes to save the day when all hope is lost\" is a fairly repetitive theme but nevertheless, hypes you up every single time. Overall: 8/10 Definitely something you can binge read and reread multiple times as it's just that engrossing. The Manhwa art style could initially throw you off but if you stick around it's worth it. Go forth and dive right into it. Love and peace my friends :)"}, {"score": "6", "content": "The most action packed manhwa you'll find is Solo Leveling in a nutshell. While it may be extremely entertaining and if that's what you're looking for this manhwa is perfect but aside from that it lacks in every category and is extremely poorly written. I'll start with the pros, Solo Leveling was one of the first manhwas to do dungeons, necromancer and system this well and it also had good entertaining fights against the many many generic antagonists. The artwork is extremely well done and only adds more to the insane fight scenes. Now for the cons, first Sung Jin-woo is one of the worst protagonists I've ... ever seen and it hurts since he had so much potential. He started as this weakling who's looked down by everyone and struggled to survive for strength but as the series continues nothing else happens he basically stays the same being emotionless, edgy and has no motivation or ideals besides the class shonen generic tropes. He had his moments but aside from 1 or 2 good scenes his development is insanely bad and overall is a weak MC. Next the side cast, while the story is revolved around the MC it makes sense that the side cast isn't focused on and I understand that but what annoys me is how every arc is the exact same, new cast, new dungeon, new generic enemy etc. As soon as the arc ends we never see the characters again even if they are semi important such as the world class hunters, the demoness in the 100 floor dungeon etc. Finally the plot, honestly it actually isn't that bad, it's decently made for a dungeon manhwa and is surprisingly better than what I expected. Overall if you want pure entertainment, fights and to turn your brain off while reading Solo Leveling is perfect but if you want anything that makes a story and it's characters good you will be extremely disapointed."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Amazing, simply amazing. No real spoilers in this review. Also, please pardon any grammatical errors, English is not my native language. After I finished chapter 90, I started with the novel because I couldn't wait for the next chapter. I will talk about the Manga but I will mention a few things about the novel. The story is very typical, nothing outstanding about the theme. What does make a difference, without a doubt, is the way the story is told. The manga does a good job at portraying the novel but, of course, it cannot emphasize all the aspects and depth of the novel. The story gets ... surprisingly interesting after the character gets a \"job\". It is something I completely did not expect but after finishing the following chapter I could not be happier. The characters feel very real, they make decisions like a real person would; not the typical cliched Japanese characters. Hence, the Korean origin of this piece of art. When I read it and got into the story, I eagerly waited for the decisions the MC would take. Several of them are surprising. Some of them I agreed with, other I did not but I was able to understand his point of view. (Novel) The main character goes through a fantastical metamorphosis throughout the story but at the same time he remains stagnant. He keeps his more inner values and morals intact although knowing that he has to make the hard choices when it really matters. The art is fabulous. It really matches the quality of the story. Nothing else to say about that. Please read the novel of this story, it will not disappoint. With nothing else to add, I can honestly say that it is one of the best stories I have read in quite a while."}, {"score": "10", "content": "The premise of Solo Levelling is very simple: A weak character with strong principles who obtains an unqiue ability of \"levelling up\" and improving his strength and skills in a relatively static environment where power levels are fixed. The Manwha constantly enforces this where we see him grow constantly and the comparisons and contrasts to other characters. Story- 8/10 Once this is out of the way, we see the story revolve around this. There isn't too much in the story: the world-base is fascinating where we have \"hunters\" with supernatural powers who appeal (or seemingly) to the common good by ridding the world of monsters, typically ... through clearances of dungeons. Dungeons vary in difficultly based on ranks that correlate to the ranks and ability of hunters. The story starts out very intriguing giving the reader the glimpse of the real world dread of the story seeing the real glimpse of what a dungeon represents. The MC on the brink of the death manages to obtain a mysterious power- turning him from the weakest hunter into someone with unlimited potential. The story follows the MC with the pondering question of who or what the system is through the interaction of the interesting world. At this point, the story of the MC is average since we don't truly dive into the main plot points. It gets a boost for it's interesting arcs of exposition and environment. Art- 10/10 The art is truly spectacular. The manwha clearly displays consistent, versatile effort with some of the most spectacular shots. There isn't much more to say. Character- 8/10. While we do see the MC change quite noticeably and gradually along the series the character does seem to lose some of it's intrigue and fleshiness glimpsed in the beginning of the series. Sure, the MC gets powerful along the way, but he quickly becomes quite bland and generic. To some this may appeal because it displays \"being a badass\" but often, there seems to be a divide over the series into the reader understanding him as a character such as his more vulnerable parts. Again that ties in to becoming more powerful, he is still likeable and grows but becoming stronger increases his confidence and we rarely now seem in his deathly or dire situations that show out his character. Perhaps this will happen in time. Enjoyment- 10/10 Seriously, this Manwha is action packed to the max where every chapter seems to have amazing scenes. The thrill by the author of having more and more characters in an enormous world keeps an endless potential for readers to see both the aspects of the world itself and the MC's dynamics towards it. The best part? Every arc is worth it because we as the reader are rewarded with seeing the MC grow in power- new skills, skill point enhancement (think RPG), job classes, its always a thrill. Overall- 10/10 This isn't everyones cup of tea. Solo Levelling definitely appeals to a more generic audience looking for amazing skills, abilities, monsters in an interesting setting with easier and quicker payoffs. The pacing set allows readers to never feel dull. Because of the many aspects of the world and character, readers can be captivated knowing each chapter is worthwhile."}, {"score": "10", "content": "What I may be talking about in this review may have some spoilers, you are warned (honestly, I'd still say you should read what I have to say).

It exceeds the normal japanese manga I regularly read. This manga is after all a Korean manga, which doesn't change the fact, ... that the artstyle and just art in general exceeds what I've seen or read so far. I normally don't take the time to actually enjoy how the art looks in a manga, but when there's an entire page just dedicated to the art, you will be blown away because of the advanced details there is in it. The fact it's coloured as well, may increase the enjoyment of reading it, but if you just stumble upon the page with just art, don't skip by it. Just take your time and actually proceed it. You'll be speechless, well I wasn't, but almost. Now I've been mostly describing the artstyle, which in it self is a whole different league, but the story too! At first glance, you may think it's just the regular \"main character trying to afford a family member's medical bills\", which actually is the main character's true reason to actually do what he does, but from being the lowest of the lowest and yet keep fighting even though he may die, he continues, and because of his courage and desire to have his mom get better, pushed him so far, that he actually managed to exceed anyone around him's expectation. He didn't get an \"ULTIMATE POWERUP\", but he actually got the ability to actually improve gradually with time, and the more he did it, the stronger he became (cliché like, I know, but done so great compared to other). Even though I binged 110 chapters (the current amount there's out there for now) in a day doesn't mean I was so captivated by it. I just didn't have anything to do besides that. And no, it's not because I am forced to stay inside in these lockdown times with COVID-19. I have my reasons. But the fact that I spent around 6 hours, binge reading all 110 chapters, was actually really fun for me. I enjoyed reading it. I didn't skip a chapter, though I might've skipped some pointless conversations between add in characters, just to fill the blanks, but I read at least 95% of all the chapters and pages. Even though it may seem odd I gave it a 10 out of 10 in all catagories, it's not because I've become charmed by the manga, but it's because I enjoyed reading it and I will continue reading it up to date, and I would really recommend this manga to other people who have the interest in adventure mangas or something similar to a isekai.

Solo leveling started out amazing, with an incredible introductory few chapters. The next following arcs aren't perfect, but begin to show potential for an interesting internal conflict, and by chapter 50 everything has fallen apart, and has been disregarded, to be turned into a mind numbing, wish fulfilment power fantasy with nothing else. I have heard the main selling point for this manhwa (and anime) is how fun it is, and how a simple story is still good. NO it fails at both first let me address the \"fun\" part. Turning my brain off ... should not be the requirement for me to enjoy something. Its cope, because if you bothered to think about what you're consuming you'd realize that you're just consuming wish fulfilment slop. I can't have fun with this because everything I came for has been thrown away for a pathetic power fantasy. If I wanted to turn my brain off, I'd go watch Instagram reels. second is the \"simple\" story. Nobody said simple stories are bad. This justification is just used by people who can't see the issue with what they're watching. A simple story is something that is easy to follow, not every story needs to ask ambiguous questions about life's purpose or moral alignment, sometimes it can just be about someone struggling with being weak and he gets strong and save his family. But Solo Leveling is not a simple story, its a broken story. You could throw simple story at so many other pieces of media, and you'll find they're far more polished, and have more love put into them. The story is broken because it very likely didn't have a second draft. The final antagonist comes out of nowhere. Jinwoo's and Cha-Hae in's relationship (and of course she's the crazy attractive hunter everyone drools over) is poorly developed in practice. THE FIGHT SCENES (which everyone obsesses over) are stale, unimaginative, and repetitive. All dialogue scenes in part 2 are genuinely so boring I stopped reading midway through (its either \"oh no there's a problem\", or its glazing jinwoo). And all villains are either two or one dimensional. And the ending. without spoiling, it is nothing short than a betrayal of everything we've been through, and a pointless way to make everything \"perfect\" in the end. All for the combined result of making Jinwoo simply the most powerful at the very end. So the entire reason of the ending was just to have another power fantasy where no one else is special except Jinwoo. This story was very clearly written for nothing more than a self-indulgent power fantasy, so if you had to fix it, it would need a whole redo: - START by giving Jinwoo complications with the level of his strength, maybe he doens't have the time to spend with his family who need him (afterall he's doing this for them). Show others saying they feel distant or left behind because jinwoo is on his own or is too powerful to compare to. - Make the progression in strength slower, giving room for rivalries, and pursuits for strength which will make for a far more satisfying conclusion to killing a boss. - The side characters need a complete rework, not every character needs to love jinwoo if they're a good guy, and hate him if they're bad. Take Gojo from jujutsu kaisen for example, he stood as the strongest and could do everything, yet even the good guys thought he was annoying or irresponsible. But at the end of the day, they could still rely on him to save everyone. (and still looks cool while doing it) - The idea that the system was changing his personality was an early tease at what the story could be (and then it was thrown away), so bringing it back as a side struggle he has to control, or something he needs to take into consideration before making a decision as it could potentially go sideways, would be a good way to develop Jinwoo's character, and it would actually make us like him more (because we would see him trying to fight to do the right thing) - Give the whole thing a do over, properly introduce new characters and remember to develop existing subplots that got axed the chapter after they happened (a very particular moment with Jin-ah might I add). Develop friendships through struggle, show they can rely on Jinwoo, and that Jinwoo has people to go to that can console him when he gets tired or feels weak. Since I can't just poke fun at the show I thought I might as well add to it. Oh yeah and the art is good, that's the whole reason this manhwa is even recognized to be one of the bests (for some reason). If you value storytelling as a medium then I would steer very clear from this manhwa, don't let anyone else fool you into thinking its good. It quite literally is just an over-glorified power fantasy. Anyone who says that Jinwoo is amazing either doesn't understand that he isn't and fell for the power fantasy trap, or they attribute \"amazing\" to mean fun, (which I have already described, it is not) This is also many people's first manhwa, so they might be enamored by how \"different\" it feels. It is just the same power fantasy that every other litrpg has, except jinwoo has to earn his levels, but only for 30ish chapters because by that point, he isn't in any threat and can easily deal with any problem, while simultaneously gaining levels. so in short, he is overpowered for every encounter he is needed for (except minus those few at the beginning). It took me over a year to finish this manhwa (somehow it took others 3 days), the ending made me feel like I wasted my time, and the epilogue does not fix anything that the story has ruined, but in all honesty, reading it provides no benefit, because everything that happens could be inferred by the reader when they read the ending (also the remaining quarter of it is sequel bait, so if you don't care for the sequel, don't bother reading it). That's it. It sucks that this manhwa got the A-1 pictures treatment for its anime, so now all the brain dead animation addicts flock to it thinking its best story to grace them since demon slayer (that was obviously a joke, demon slayer looks like a masterpiece in comparison (I kid you not, I was thinking that as I read this story)) Don't fall for any of the lies the fans tell you. This is nothing more than a wish fulfilment power fantasy."}, {"score": "10", "content": "\"He who fights monsters must take care that he himself does not become a monster... when you look long into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you\" - Friedrich Solo Leveling is without a doubt one of the best works I've read in all these years. History - 10 In terms of the story idea, it's pretty generic. But the way Solo Leveling transforms such a generic idea into a masterpiece is what gives it this rating. Initially, it's not that easy to understand the concept, but the more you read, the more you slowly become addicted to the story then quickly without even realizing it you ... start to understand everything. (Anyone who has played a game with dungeons will pick it up easily) For me, following Sung's growth was the most enjoyable thing about this manhwa, you know he's going to beat his enemies but he does it with so much style that you'll always want to see more. Art - 10 Without a doubt, the solo has the best and most badass art style I've ever seen in a manga/manhwa, the fact that it has color adds a lot and helps give the imaginary life you need to make the immersion. After reading this work of art I'm sure you'll be dying to see what it will look like when it's finally animated. Character - 10 Sung is certainly one of the best protagonists of all time, even after becoming practically the strongest immortal god in the universe, at no point did I feel that he lacked humanity. Even the secondary characters are very likable. The development of some was lacking, but the errors here are much smaller than the successes. Pleasure - 10 I had never finished a work with 201 caps in such a short time, this was really pleasurable and addictive. Overall rating - 100/10, I highly recommend this work and I can guarantee you won't regret reading it."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Solo leveling is manhwa about Sung jin-woo, Weakest of the weakest, loser of the losers. E-rank Hunter. Who will slowly become more and more strong, to the point that he will be some demi-god type shit. This manhwa just simply give you everything that it promise, nothing more than that. DO YOU WANT OP BADASS MC? - Yeah we have that. COOL, GOOD LOOKING FIGHTS? - As you want sir. POWER LEVEL THAT BIG THAT CAN DESTROY PLANET?- Of course we had it. ... SOME LEVEL OF DEEP FRIENDSHIP, RELATIONSHIP? - No. ANY KIND OF EMOTIONAL BACKGROUND - Nope. Y'all got what i mean, solo leveling it is just a simple manhwa about guy who becomes the strongest, beat the shit out of his enemies, and got no mercy for them, zero level of any kind of emotional connection with any other character beside the MC or even with him 'cause he never have any emotions at the first place, always the same face expression, everything the same. Other Characters leave the screen as quickly as they arrived, when you think that this time will be different, this character will be important, no, it is always a lie, They appear and never come back again. But, it's okay and the end of the day, because it's SOLO Leveling, everything you need in this series is MC and his power, no love, no friends, Just him. So, If u want simple read, to chill, not think too much and enjoy art as long as Sung destroy more and more powerful enemies with more and more crazy powerful power - Just read it. If you expect some kind of emotional attachment, some side plots, anything with any other character - U will be disappointed, 'cause all we have here is SOLO LEVELING. ah, and ending sucks, last spin-offs chapters make it little bit less disappointing."}, {"score": "10", "content": "[Spoiler free] Let's start with some basic about solo leveling.

The main reason for all this hype and popularity is Solo leveling's fantastic story telling,Character development, Goal setting and flamboyant art-style.The character design is next level.Artist Hyoen-Gun & Jang-Sung-Rak used digital ... painting and gradient which provided a 3D feeling to the characters.They used the web-comic feature as their advantage and utilized it fully.Each fight scene feels dynamic and spellbound. Solo leveling is an adaption of the Light Novel 'I alone level up/Solo leveling' by the author chu-gong.His story telling is so fulfilling that from very beginning it's more than enough to hold the reader to complete the remaining chapter as soon as possible.'Solo leveling' is like 'One punch man' but here we get to see him getting stronger and gain the recognition our MC deserves. If you are one of the person who sweats about small stuff and can't wait for a mystery to be revealed then continuing this manhwa will be difficult for you. 'The name of the main character is Jin-Woo who survived a difficult situation and was granted a option to become a player(Nope it's not isekai). He was the sole person to get the opportunity and was awarded with a function called system.What is this system?Why is this system?Who runs this system?This 3 question is shrouded with mystery and will be revealed at the halfway of the manhwa.In order to enjoy the story you will need to stop asking this 3 question to yourself again and again'.

It's the very first time I've seen some well-written overpowered character. Solo leveling tells the story of Sung Jin Woo, the most weaker Hunter of Korean, at least. The first 11-12 chapters introduce us to how the world around works, which class do what and the whole thing. It really annoying in some way, because it don't show you the very potential of the story itself. It hard to swallow, but after that comes the best part till the end. In introducing chapters we see a weaker, boring and cliche protagonist that we all have seen in most ... other series, but take it from me, after these chapters the thing changes to a whole new level. We see the start of his evolution, all the way through, and the character development through that. There's the thing that makes it cool. The way that show us the fights, the skills that he acquired through time, the whole thing is magical. One thing really awesome about this manhwa it's the pages format. It seems made to read on a mobile device, cuz the way the scenario moves, the way the characters does too, dope af, I think it's the most positive point about this series. So colorful and well made. If I had to stands out something besides the pages format, it's, of course, the dungeons and the bosses. It's so dope and astonishing at the same time. A variety of scenarios, every boss has something to add in some way, no matter what. And that's really beautiful to see. I hope we get the second season as soon as possible, I can't contain myself!

But that touch would've been great."}, {"score": "3", "content": "I didn't write a review for this originally because I wanted to forget the time I wasted reading this but a certain event brought back bad memories of this. I just said that I finished because it would look silly to have my Chapters at like 180/201. You may be wondering you were so close to finishing why not just finish it to give it an honest review? The last couple of chapters I was literally reading and forgetting simultaneously because of how dumb the plot got and how little I cared. Originally Solo Leveling was just fight scenes and amazing art, then you had characters ... who barely even knew Jinwoo start to be overly emotionally invested in him, so that's weird. Then the entire verse starts simping for him and you start to question whether he's the Shadow Monarch or the Simp Monarch. You have men more infatuated with him than their significant other that they would probably be jealous when Jinwoo takes them to bed because it wasn't him instead. The author of Solo Leveling watched Naruto and saw their ending and said hold my beer, you think you can out do me, a Manwha author at a stupid plot? The moment it became about the plot and not Jinwoo no diffing every adversary in the story, was when it became unreadable. Reading Solo Leveling early on gives vibes of being young and going to the library and picking up a comic and reading it, it gives that old school aesthetic of just action with zero substance and that's fine, because that's the only reason why I stuck through it as long as I did. It wasn't an amazing series, it was palatable with the art being top tier and I could just block out the cringe of the sea of simps in the series. The author really had a hay day writing this, bro made the most bland character to self insert himself and start glazing himself to the point where the donut is gone and all you have is the sugar coating. These overly hyped series such as Chainsaw Man, Oshi No Ko, Solo Leveling are being pushed by the readers of the source material and due to the fact that their fandom is so MASSIVE that they're able to spin narratives and mind control people into thinking it's something that it's not. The only series that I can give props to, who had an organic blow up was Demon Slayer because it wasn't popular and in fact the anime throughout wasn't even all that popular but a singular episode put that series to heights that no anime has ever achieved overnight. Don't get it twisted, I don't like Demon Slayers much either."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Solo Leveling A manwha that almost everyone has certainly heard of, it is predominantly referred to as \"The best of the best\". I have waited a very long time for it to finally end so I can read it. And now it was so far, I have read the manga in 2.5 days finished and must say that I was relatively disappointed. It is an indisputable fact that Solo Leveling has an immensely good art style and is probably the \"coolest\" manwha in the world. I have never read an anime or manga that is as badass as Solo Leveling. BUT, these are also the only ... 2 strengths of the Manwha, the rest is mostly average or worse. In other words, the whole Manwha is just a big display of fan service from the protagonist. Now and then I had the feeling that the author was about to come into my room to tell me how cool the protagonist is because you had not yet understood that while reading. The biggest problem with Solo Leveling is the individuality, variety, and characters. The manga is very monotonous in the long run and the dialogues have almost no creativity, they are dull and empty. Most of the characters have design and appropriate personalities, but they are so absurdly one-dimensional, you can tell from the beginning what the character's role will be and what kind of sidekick he will end up as. Since most characters have screentime of only one minute anyway, that's it anyway. This takes away from the Manwha's atmosphere immensely and makes it seem very dull. In the end, there is some background on the protagonist's power and the reason for the superpowers and portals, but the background was mostly just an average fantasy plot, with hugely empty antagonists who had no personality whatsoever. [Story 5] This Manwha offers a \"Weak to Strong\" storyline, where the protagonist rises to the limitless and outstrips everyone very quickly. Power levels and hype had virtually no meaning here. No matter which character is hyped to the sky with his power and status, in the next 10 chapters he is just a sidekick because he is too weak. No matter how strong the opponent is and no matter how many times the characters tell you \"Ohh he's so strong\" the protagonist comes and finishes the whole thing playing. This sequence repeats itself often even at the beginning, but after the protagonists change classes it becomes a continuous loop. You know a similar concept from \"One Punch Man\", but there the side characters are in focus and the protagonist is far in the background. Here, however, the side characters have little relevance or screentime. But the protagonist, who constantly tells \"My status values are good, my soldiers are getting stronger\" - \"Oh the enemy is strong, yes yes very strong\" and then continues to destroy him unilaterally. Just so all the spectators can say \"oh how strong he is, who is he?!\" Because of this monotonous flow and the constantly questionable clarifications about how strong the opponents are, you completely lost the sense of danger. The very first arc (The Double Dungeon) was the only one where you felt a real one-sided danger and cared about the survival of the characters. From then on there was nothing, you just wondered when the protagonist would come so that everything would end. It would all have been a lot less bad if the pacing had been slowed down a bit to build up the characters more and slow down the protagonist's progress. Especially since there wouldn't have been a constant attempt to push in your face how cool the protagonist is. At the end of the story you at least saw some plot, which in the end was only average but better than nothing. The concept of the background story reminded me a bit of the manga \"Gantz\", but better implemented. Nevertheless, the fact that the whole finale had no atmosphere stands. You didn't hope to see \"what happens\" but that finally \"something happens\". [Characters 3] Beru is the best character in Manwha and my absolute favorite, although he had practically no screentime as Beru. Why Beru? Because simply no character in Manwha has been even slightly sympathetic, except for the protagonist's soldiers. The protagonist, in the beginning, was someone who regretted his weakness and defied death over and over again, this was the reason for the beginning of the story. He became stronger and more controlled about his emotions. Unfortunately, from then on he had no more developments and became immensely monotonous. Except for his skill points and soldier development, he had had no dialogues whatsoever and certainly no monologues. Most of the other characters were only one-dimensional. The protagonist's simp just wanted to be his friend all the time. People who wanted to hire him into his guild (who were introduced at the beginning as complete badass characters, but ended up as sidekicks). Later, around Chapter 60, the female protagonist was introduced, who was also completely one-dimensional and had almost no personality until the end. Only the scene with the pickaxe was considered good and that's it. There were many characters, but none at all that I would call at least average. The characters with the best potential for development died too early in the beginning. And that's not the worst of it. The \"antagonists\" are also known as the monarchs. Cool idea, but poor implementation. No matter what the author tried, he couldn't create any hype around them. Igris, the statue, and Tusk alone had more hype as bosses than ALL the Monarchs combined. Not only that, but the monarchs barely possessed any personality. They were simply empty. Their endings didn't feel satisfying either, because there was simply no reason for them to be. If I may be honest, the best monarch was the monarch of the beginning, the monarch of the giants. Although he had a lesser role, he possessed the strongest scene. [Images / Representations 9] Even at the beginning, the Manwha had impressed and captivated me with its epic illustrations. How well the author managed to represent such oppressive feelings and the creative presence of the monsters. He continued to do so until about Chapter 120. Only later did his creativity diminish significantly after the monarchs were introduced. They didn't look particularly fascinating to either humans or monsters. Alone some High Orcs, possessed better and more detailed designs than the Monarchs. That being said, I'm glad that the author had improved significantly in the area of proportions. In the beginning, there were some scenes where especially female characters had very uneven eye proportions. And for men, the legs were almost as long as in \"Code Geass\". But I didn't notice this at all from Chapter 40+ on. Somehow, in the beginning, you had more problems with the style of the characters than with the monsters. Other than that, everything continued to be epic. [Conclusion] If anyone ever asks me what was the coolest comic you've ever read, I'll say \"Solo Leveling\". But as far as \"best\" goes, Solo Leveling was still worlds away from it. It was cool and fascinating to read. I kept feeling like I had to keep reading and didn't want to stop. The author did that well. But in the area of suspense, characters, and ... Dialogues, the Manwha was very disappointing and almost amusingly bad from time to time. Nevertheless, Solo Leveling was a very interesting experience and I am glad to have read it. Even if all this hype, could hardly be further from reality.

The story i don't know how they did it, it's fast paced, but in a good way, i think it's got to do with the number of plots, there's not a lot of side plots in this manhwa, they're mostly focused on the mc only, i think that's probably why this is an easy read. I remember when I first read this, it was about when it started getting the hype and i planned to only check out 10 chapters, but i managed to read 100 chapters in one night and when i reread this ... because the epilogue is finally done, i finished it in the span of 4 days, if not for my fever i could've done it in 2 at max. It is still really enjoyable even from re-reading it and going back from the beginning as if I'm re-discovering it again. There's nothing new or innovative to this series, but somehow it works and it's really popping off, they just did what they had to do and stuck the landing. My problem is that, when we got to the last arc, i think things started getting really fast paced, i think for me this series is too short, this could've made it to at least the size of the big 3, there's a lot of interesting things that were introduced in this world, but i think they just brushed it off, because they only want to focus on the Main Character only, especially in the side characters side and the guild, but they just crammed it all in the last arc, which was really disappointing for me. The art still holds up to this day, it is one of the most well done manhwa series out there. The epilogue i think that was really unnecessary, especially since the original artist is dead, the idea was really good, but you can tell the vibe is not there anymore, there's even a difference in art style and sometimes it's not consistent. Overall, it's still a goated title, i would still probably reread this again in the future since it's really really good."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Solo Leveling is one of the many stories you can find at the medium where a guy goes from level 1 crook to level 100 boss because of some cheat-like ability or situation that make the protagonist basically have unlimited potential, this type of premise surely isn't hard to find, \"Tensei Shitara no Slime Datta Ken\", \"Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?\", \"Re:Monster\", \"Arifureta: From Common Place to World Strongest\" all have a protagonist that is clearly overpowered in comparison to the rest of the world. After reading this type of story again and again, I can say, at least for me, this type of story ... starts strong but only grows weaker thereafter, and that is due to a sense of lack of challenge that only grows stronger as the story develops itself. CHARACTERS 3/10 Let's talk about the protagonis, when the story starts Jin-Woo is just an E-rank hunter who got the strange ability to grow stronger after \"surviving\" against a monster miles ahead of his power, it is a very good start, we know that he is weak, we know that he has only his wits, we know that he's doing his best for his family, we feel sympathetic for this poor guy, so as he grows stronger, the reader also gains this sense of accomplishment, because we know how hard he is training to achieve his goal, but this doesn't last long, the story grows specifically dull after he gains his job(which I will not explain because it's very important to the story), because then the story changes from \"a weakling with a meek personality trying his best to become stronger\" to \"an overpowered hack with a change of personality so sudden that makes you think he must have some sort of multiple personality disorder, oh did I also mensioned that he is now hot and perfect in every sense of the word\" basically, a lot of people enjoyed his change of personality, but I found it bad, it felt like we changed protagonist mid-history, if you like badass-like characters you may not find this change as bad as I do. Changing the topic to the side characters, they are not well used, they mostly just serve to hype the protagonist, this is more evident when the S-rank hunters first appear, they are supposed to be at the top of the hunters hierarchy and yet when they are shown their only job is making Jin Woo look badass, is like putting a bunch of Mercedes inline which one Lamborghini standing out, sure the Mercedes is a very good car, but why to care for it when you have a fucking Lamborghini in the house of the $500000,00 along with them, that's what happens here, the side characters are good and strong in its own rights, but it's difficult to care for them when you know the protagonist is not only stronger but better at literally anything they ever try to attempt, the characters are in my opinion the weakest point in the whole manhwa. ART 10/10 The art is pretty damn good, it's not even the type of art that I like but I have to give it to the artist of this manhwa, he nailed it, the colors, the character design, the environment, the art is not only the thing that draws most attention but is also the best part of the manga overall, especially the use of colors, I had never seen a mawnha make such good use of the fact that they can be colored, truly an outstanding work Story 5/10 The story isn't anything outstanding but it isn't bad, despite the lack of good characters the fact that the protagonist is always getting thrown at some new situation totally different from the last makes for a story that, albeit lacking, never feels totally tired out, the visual differences from one setting to another and the different ways the enemies are portrayed truly sells the idea of something new, also the fact that there is always a sense of tension for the side-characters makes the things have some weight to them, but the fact that the protagonist is near-invincible makes the parts of the story where is only him against the world have much less weight, after all, you know he is gonna succeed. Because of that most of the situations change from \"OMG, are the characters gonna be able to win\" to \"OMG, how long until Jin-Woo arrives\" which leaves a bad taste after the arc reaches its conclusion since the solution is basically the same every time(SPOILER), use shadow, defeat strong enemy, make strong enemy a shadow, repeat. ENJOYMENT 6/10 The characters and the story aren't very good, but the art, the flashy powers, the hype when the protagonist arrives at the fight, and the feeling of getting always stronger makes a somehow enjoyable experience OVERALL 6/10 Albeit lacking in very key aspects the story is flashy and hype enough to make a somehow good read, it's definitely no masterpiece, but it's a fun read to have in an afternoon. Recommend if you like overpowered characters, outstanding art, or the trope of the protagonist that grow stronger as if they are in a game."}, {"score": "6", "content": "I'm not going to explain much why I believe this manhwa is extremely overrated, since they are probably people who could do it better, but in general I think people think it’s a masterpiece because of the idea behind it.

For example: Boku ... no Hero Academia, Parasyte (maybe?), Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Hajime No Ippo, Naruto, Haikyuu!!, Bleach, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (also maybe?), Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, Dragon Ball, almost every shonen and a lot more (correct me if I’m wrong).

Please stop lying to yourself you gotta wake up man. Solo leveling is probably the most overrated, over anticipated and overhyped manhwas I've ever seen. The entire plot is boring and predictable. MC goes on a quest in the hidden dungeon, gets stronger by obtaining more \"exp\", acquires stronger abilities, go out the dungeon, fights monsters with other squad members in a high class dungeon, and repeat. There is a lack of direction with the story as a whole. Not really anything has been revealed about the objective of the story, the purpose of ... the system, or how the MC gets so ridiculously strong, or why he was chosen to receive this power. It's just, \"oh there are monsters threatening humanity, so I gotta save people cause I gotta be the good guy\". Despite the lack of direction though, I did enjoy how the story was always constantly evolving from the previous arcs. There was always a change, however, in the recent chapters, that change has became a lot more subtle. Because of the MC insane power, no one really holds a threat to him anymore. In fact, he is so overpowered, there has been no antagonist that actually put this man's life at risk in a fight. And this is why this sucks so much. Solo leveling loves to hype up its villains. The author makes these villains seem unbeatable and insanely strong, long before the MC actually bothers fight them. For example, the king ant during the Walmart chimera ant arc. He is shown to have power that no hunter can possibly match. It easily killed the Japanese S rank hunter who was shown to be able to go head to head against the MC. It also cornered 4 S class hunters by itself, not to mention, killed basically every single S class hunter from Japan. Now, before you say, \"oh those guys were weak, they weren't that strong.\" many of these hunters were basically the strongest in the world. The Japanese guild that these S class hunters came from were regarded as one of the best guilds in Japan, and the ant just wiped out nearly all of its members by itself, WITHOUT trying. However, as soon as the ant fought the MC, it got folded like an omelet. It's boring to see such strong, evil and interesting villains get beat so easily, with no real tension or risk. It takes away the sense of uncertainty of failure that was in the early parts of the show. Oh so you're sad that these badass villains are gone, and we would just have to wait for the MC to beat another one's ass 20 chapters later? Oh no problem! Introducing the revival system!(or better known as ASSWIPE PLOT ARMOUR) The author realizes that if every badass villain gets destroyed, it would take away the enjoyment of the show, so now the MC can make these villains his personal bodyguards, in a shadow form, because of course, he just does not want to see these great villains go, so now they can stay in the story forever! It's so stupid, as if the author can't stand seeing characters die or smth, like cmon man, let these guys rest. Now, we're finally done with the atrocious plot, lets get onto the characters. All I can say is that their bad. The MC is basically god, the side characters are more bland than my grandma's oatmeal, and the antagonists are all just brainless monsters. There has so far been only 2 human antagonists, who actually had personalities and motives, but don't get too excited, cause they're both dead. Not to mention, they were both just douchebags who were just bad for no real apparent reason. Not to mention, the side characters basically receive unlimited and unbeatable plot armor from anything, cause our MC would just kill anything that's remotely dangerous to them. It's so boring and predictable, and it really takes away from the potential character development that we could've gotten. Now we're at the art. If you actually bothered to stay this long, then you might think that I'll shit on this too, but I have to admit, the art is pretty good. Not vagabond good, but it's definitely pretty good. I enjoyed the designs of the monsters, and the coloring is superb. It really is its only selling point though(at least for me.) In conclusion, Solo leveling is just really generic and boring. There's really nothing outstanding about this except for the art, and even then, it's not enough to make up for the absolute piece of shit this is."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Is this the manhwa/Korean equivalent of One Punch Man? No. Not nearly as comedic Solo leveling falls into the same abyss that a lot of manhwa fall into. The abyss which is the MC being so overpowered that the entire story seems to revolve around them, making the side characters just a conduit through with the author wants to express what he wants his audience to feel. The series is currently 150 chapters long and ongoing. The MC faced his hardest challenges in the first 50 chapters and has been on cruise control ever since. The villains and heroes alike are uninteresting over the long run, notwithstanding ... their decent showing in the short run Having said all of that, I don’t mind reading power fantasy mediocre series every now and then. If you find it fun, by all means enjoy just like I do sometimes. Everyone needs a series that you can just enjoy for what it is without thinking too much about it and Solo Leveling might be that series for you as it has been for me. Just because you enjoy something doesn’t mean its actually good though"}, {"score": "3", "content": "Solo Leveling started off good, for a manhwa anyway. I have a bias against manhwa, as they are usually a bunch of boring korean/Chinese propaganda machines with art produced by a 20-man strong team of underpaid slaves to make a mediocre-at-best power trip with all the ideas of storytelling that i hate. However, people said it was the best manhwa ever so i guess i had to try. It started as a simple Zero-to-hero story which i could get behind and i enjoyed the show for the first 50 r so chapters, the demon girl was awesome, the rest of the characters were not great, but ... for a manhwa. passable. The obvious anti-Japanese propaganda in the form of \"villains\" that made no impact (as if to state how useless they are) and a character getting so powerful it was kinda ridiculous. And you know what? i was willing to give this like a 6 or a 7 if it kept up this realm of quality, but it got mediocre near the end and the fight scenes genuinely became boring after a while, as someone who prefers CHARACTER BEATS instead of hitting some guy with a metal dagger. it got boring quick. and while literally every single character had the personality of a saltine cracker, i was still reading it, so i was willing to let it slide Then the ending decided to drop my score by 3 fucking points. (spoilers) I hate \"resets\" so reversing all character development in place for some more action was a fucking narrative disaster. The art, while impressive, needs to be held up with story because you just cant appreciate a fight scene if the outcome has no fucking stakes. And the main character was so perfect that he just HAD to fix the whole world by himself, which is an outdated and very Asian ideology that doesent sit right with me. I know its a controversial opinion with how popular it is but everyone who said it \"wasnt your average manhwa\" or, \"isnt your average power fantasy\" is a liar and i wish i didnt give manhwa another chance after being burned by its inferiority for the 4th time in a row. But the biggest offense is the main character, Sung Jin is OP, but he has nothing to threaten his overpowerdness, Ainz Oal Goon is afraid of his house of cards collapsing and his guardians betraying him when he shows weakness, so he is constantly shoved out of his comfort zone because people overestimate his self confidence, Mob from Mob Psycho is unfascinated by his powers and sees power in the ordinary and the norma, he is threatened by himself and the power he wields that could lose control and hurt others, Kumoko from im a spider so what, literally earns her power from the second she was born and despite that is constantly shoved into situations that exploit her weaknesses. ALL OF THESE CREATE TENSION AND ESTABLISH THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS POWERFUL DOESENT MEAN THEY ARE PERFECT OR WILL NEVER WITNESS HARDSHIP, BECAUSE THAT IS SIMPLY NOT ENTERTAINING. Sung Jin has no goal, he has no threat, he has no personality, so he cant feel fear, be cowardly, or even be awkward with girls because he is so perfect he isnt even a self insert character anymore cause that implies that he is an actual human being. he never feels like hes going to lose because he excersised his confidence issues that he had in the early chapters away for some fucking reason, he seduces every woman that so much as breathes the same air as him, he always saves the lives of people he cares about with perfect timing, so nobody important to him dies, in fact the only reason he goes back in time is to save 3 FUCKING PEOPLE WHO HE HAD NO REAL ATTATCHMENT TO, HIS LOVE INTEREST NEVER DIES BECAUSE HE SAVES HER WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT, HIS SISTER NEVER DIES BECAUSE HE SAVES HER JUST IN TIME BUT NOT BEFORE SOME RANDOS DIE FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT, HIS FRIENDS NEVER DIE BECAUSE HE DOES EVERYTHING HIMSELF AND HE STILL DECIDES TO ERASE THE ENTIRE FUCKING STORY WE SPENT HOURS OF OUR LIVES WATCHING BECAUSE HE IS LITERALLY TOO MUCH OF A SOLO PLAYER THAT HE DOES THINGS HIMSELF AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME EVEN MORE ALONE THAN BEFORE DESPITE BEING ALONE IN THE MAIN STORY BECAUSE THE SERIES IS CALLED SOLO FUCKING LEVELLING. WHY DID YOU NOT INTRODUCE A THREAT, WHY COULDNT YOU HAVE KEPT SUN JINS PERSONALITY FROM THE FIRST COUPLE OF CHAPTERS, WHAT IF HE TRIED TO BECOME POWERFUL BUT WAS SET BACK BY HIS VERY HIGHLY DOCUMENTED REPUTATION FOR HAVING BAD LUCK, WHY DID HIS ONE PERSONALITY TRAIT OF HAVING AN INABILITY TO ESCAPE A FIGHT UNSCATHED DISSAPEAR THE SECOND HE BECAME BUFF AND HANDSOME, WHY IS HE NO LONGER AWKWARD OR INTELLIGENT DURING FIGHTS, WHY WAS HE ONLY USING HIS BRAIN FOR THE FIRST FIGHT OF THE SERIES BUT THE REST WAS HIM JUST SHITTING HIS OP-NESS AT HIS ENEMY, WHY DOES HE NEVER ENCOUNTER A THREAT THAT NEARLY OVERCOMES HIM IN THE CLIMAX OF THE STORY AND WHEN IT EVENTUALLY DOES, WHY DOES HE NEVER CONSIDER DEFEAT AN OPTION AND HAS ENDLESS SELF CONFIDENCE THAT WAS LITERALLY NONEXISTEN AT THE BEGINNING, WHERE DID HE EVEN GENERATE SELF CONFIDENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. I THOUGHT HE STARTED OFF AS A WEAKLING WHO NEEDED TO BE PROTECTED, WHY DOES HE CHANGE THE SECOND HE GETS EVEN A TINY BIT POWERFUL, WHY DIDNT WE GET SOMETHING COOL LIKE A PRINCE OF DARKNESS THAT WAS AFRIAD OF HIS OWN NECROMANCY OR HIS ARMY OF ZOMBIE MONSTERS, OR A GUY WHO WAS SUPER POWERFUL BUT BAD AT COMMUNCATION, OR A GUY WHO WAS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL BUT CONSTANTLY UNDERMINED BY HIS OWN LACK OF CONFIDENCE OR LITERALLY ANY ANOTHER EXTERNAL ISSUE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. Holy Shit! TLDR: good start, boring middle, and actively offensive and insulting ending that invalidates any investment i had in the show, no matter how little it was.

Giving 5/10 is enough. I had high expectations since there's a huge hype surrounding this series and people keep on saying it's great etc etc so i tried it out. I am so disappointed (1) the story: this is elementary level story. I remember watching Sailormoon back then, when they have the same scenarios repeated for several episodes lmao. SL is not different tbh. A gate will open, team will enter it, thinking they can handle the monsters, turnout it is stronger than they expected, Jinwoo would appear and save everyone ... while displaying his OP skills. And the cycle goes on and on. It's pretty tiring. I was waiting for some kind of twist or surprise but to my dismay, the story is pretty mid. (2)characters: Jinwoo is a boring character. no development whatsoever except his growing powers. yeah, he's OP but that's it. not really fun to watch. well, some people might enjoy him but not for me, i expect for more. and surprisingly,other characters are just like him, dull and boring. the only character that amazed me so far is Jin Ho. the rest are like his shadow army, lifeless.

The art saved this series. if without it, SL will be a total waste of time."}, {"score": "2", "content": "This manhwa is terrible and overrated. The beginning is enjoyable because there are actually stakes, but after the MC gets his initial set of powerups the quality of the writing quickly falls off. The main character barely has a personality or any interesting goals, and the other characters in the story are equally as undeveloped and only serve to make the MC look more impressive by gawking at his prowess, in the case of his allies, or by being beaten by him easily, in the case of enemies. The worldbuilding is mediocre; a generic \"hunter association\" plus RPG game-like setting commonly found in trashy manhwa ... like this. In summary, Solo Leveling is a cringe power fantasy that isn't even fun to read because of its subpar writing. The only redeeming quality about this work is the artwork, which saves it from me giving it a 1-star rating."}, {"score": "10", "content": "The Story: 10/10 Absolutely solid, it flows extremely well and is probably one of the best adaptions of a LN into a Manhwa I've ever seen. The story is filled with plots that make sense, flowing with extremely well written character development, assisted by very good character interactions. Of course, like many stories, it starts out slow. When I first started reading this story definitely pissed me off to the point that I was like \"Does this even get better.\" Yes, yes it does. You may be annoyed with the MC and many supporting characters in the beginning but that quickly changes as the character begins to go through a ... change no one in this fantasy world has experienced before. He is able to level up his rank. Through that experience he drastically changes in personality and is able to experience much more action than previously before, at the bottom of the barrel. This manhwa quickly becomes exciting to read and you'll continuously be asking for more after finishing each chapter. Give it a chance and run through the chapters, I'm sure it's something all action and fantasy lovers will enjoy. Art: 10/10 This is where Solo Leveling shines above all it's competitors. What starts off as mediocre art suddenly improves drastically to become pure joy to look at, I've never seen manhwa done so beautifully. It's so unique you can't really compare it to art you see from something like OPM for example. Each panel is a sight to behold and truly makes you appreciate it on a whole other level. Keeping in mind it's released on a weekly basis which is unbelievable. Enjoyment: 10/10 In every aspect this is a masterpiece to behold and I urge you to give this a fair chance, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it.

I loved how the main character unlike in one punch man got found out and how he became the strongest hero. (I read the novel) It is honestly so thrilling even the novels good. I loved ... this so much, he has to face so many trials and you might not know what I'm talking about unless you read ahead in the novel.

As one would expect from null to OP-type stories, it's easy to root for our protagonist at the beginning until the ease of how this leveling becomes apparent.

Opportunity lost in character development (and skill polishing) overall with many of the other characters condemned to background noise; even for a title named Solo Leveling some filler ins for world building sake are important. The attempt at that is a mom who's ... storyline is condemned to obscurity before we can care for her and a sister whose purpose is still lost on the reader. Skill upgrades breeze by like nothing and shadow warriors are acquired so easily. That said, this won't disappoint fans of the genre. Nothing new from the storyline. Artwork is stellar.

That was all uvu"}, {"score": "10", "content": "I regret not picking this up earlier. I tried reading it months ago, gave up on it. My initial thoughts were \"Jesus Christ, this can't get any more clichè and generic.\" After a break, I once again tried to read it, but was stuck on the same thought. And finally, after another break, I picked it up a third time and.. well, I was very stupid for judging it from the earliest chapters. I very much find isekais and \"dungeon/player\" based works boring. I actually cannot stand them. All predictable plots, bland OP characters, harem, etc etc. Stating this I'm here to explain why i think ... Solo Leveling is a golden piece of work amongst its kind. The 10 rating is not to be compared to other incredible manga/manhwa out there, it's solely based on the genre this manhwa is going for, which is the overly done player trope. Story: 9 You can predict the plot, to some extent. You can definitely predict when the MC is going to win the battle, which.. most of the time is indeed the case, but the elements that make the story flow are really interesting and of a grand scale. There is not once that you forget why the MC is doing this, or why he's doing that. There is no tiptoeing the plot. It is very plot-driven, and is as linear as it can get- again, to some extent, because there can be multiple objectives at a time for which the MC is making an action. You never feel that the manhwa has a bit lost its focus, it's clear that the author has a clear idea in mind and the raised questions from the beginning are never left hanging. I very much appreciate this. Of course, the manhwa is far from over (I'm at ch. 153) so there are still larger matters to unfold. You can say that the plot has been already done but it's executed in such a way pertaining to the characteristics of the manhwa's fictional world and its characters, that it personally just makes me feel very invested. Art: 10 Simply excellent. Low reviews are bashing the art- how? It is objectively good. Very detailed, vibrant colors, body proportions and faces havent got a single flaw, the battle scenes are incredibly dynamic and i can feel the impact of every hit and power outburst. The art is the best thing in this manhwa, and it's one of the, if not the best, drawn manhwa i've read (action-wise). 100+ chapters in and i still pause on each panel to take in the satisfactory visuals. Character: 7 While i personally find the characters entertaining, i can recognize their flaws. MC: Sung Jinwoo.The almost immediate change of character is what characterises him the most, although his main values remain unaltered which is saving his mother, helping others, and becoming stronger. He is the definition of \"badass\" and of \"prowess\". His execution is flawless in everything. No detail escapes him. He also appears as arrogant which isn't necessarily a bad thing because with infinite power, arrogance is to be expected and is validated. He acts arrogantly but never rude. He's just aware that nothing and no one can touch him. With his family he's the same caring son/brother and will risk his life and leave everything behind not only to save his family but also his friends. One thing to be noted is that he doesn't get invincible right off the bat- there is a continuous progress of getting stronger, which results in aquiring skills, job titles, new levels, new shadows. He's by no doubt an interesting-to-watch character but his personality could be something more than a dude who always shows an immaculate face. Side characters: The designs fits them all. Some hunters, while powerful, are also bussinesmen, and their black suits fit them very well. People are generally dressed casually, adapting to our modern world. I must say some faces are memorable like Cha Hae In, Thomas Andre, Lhu Zhigeng and the old man CEO of the Hunter's Association. Personality wise they're still entertaining and it's fascinating to see what each of their strength is (although very lacking in comparison to our OP Sung Jinwoo), but they're pretty much kissing his butt all the time. It's understandable, but i wish they had more personality. Foes: Their designs are absolutely cool, very detailed and the non-human creatures have more personality than the side characters... maybe because most of them don't wet themselves at the sight of Jinwoo. The King Statue in the Cartenon temple is especially impressive in its depiction: it makes you feel little and insignificant compared to his stature and sheer enormity, and to top it all his expression is a hella scary one. Entertainment: 10 It's obvious that despite these flaws i'm enthralled by every chapter, which is the first time to happen to me when it comes to this kind of genre. Overall: 10 An action-packed, plot-driven manhwa, with badass and OP characters (besides our MC), just as badass foes, and amazing art to solidify it. I hope it only gets better from now onwards."}, {"score": "10", "content": "i dont really get why people say the artwork in this is just \"decent\" or that the storyline is boring.

It is literally in the name."}, {"score": "10", "content": "NO SPOILERS! Solo leveling is just like going to your favorite restaurant and getting the same thing you always order, never to be disappointed. You already know what you're in for, you know what to expect, but it doesn't change the fact that you're still going to order that same thing every time you go there. Solo leveling may not have a lot of new things to bring to the table in terms of the usual \"mmo style isekai fantasy inspired\" media, but it does everything spectacularly. A lot of people say the story is repetitive and does the same thing over and over, but honestly that ... doesn't bother me in the slightest. That's exactly what I expect from Solo Leveling and its exactly what I get! The action is badass, the vertical scrolling style is fantastic and its something I've personally never seen before and I seriously enjoyed it. The battles and action sequences are very well designed with this layout in mind, and it does a lot of seriously cool shit with it. The artwork is insane. Really. Its beautiful. Part of what got me to get through the beginning of the story (which isn't inherently bad, just a bit of a slow ramp up) was how incredible the artwork is! Being able to scroll through amazingly colored and detailed pages seemingly forever really had an appeal to me, and I was increasingly impressed as the story progressed. It helps to suck you in and make you pause on some pages longer than you'd expect just to survey the details in the illustration. The storyline I really enjoyed. If you appreciate the other aspects of the manga at this point then you'll either enjoy the story, or enjoy everything else enough to stick along for the ride. Oh you think there's going to be some twist that the main character has to overcome? Nope, he demolished what could have been an arc in a few pages. Granted the stakes increase as the story progresses, and the characters and their development are fantastic in my opinion. I love the other hunters personalities and abilities and think that it plays off of Sung Jin Woo perfectly. This is a no compromises power fantasy that knows exactly what you want to see, and ramps it up from there. If you like the OP MC stuff as a bit of a guilty pleasure comfort food like myself, then you'll definitely enjoy this!

When I read Solo Leveling last year on the homepage of my preferred manga website I went in expecting the typical edgy power up trope that plagues most stories in the isekai genre. Despite SL not being Isekai per say, I found that it was just as mediocre as most isekai stories. I read the whole thing, enjoyed it a bit for it's art and fight scenes, and then left. By the time I had finished, I was completely unaware of the hype surrounding this series. I was unaware that it was being referred to as a masterpiece, and that it was rated among the ... top 15 manga, above webtoons such as \"Bastard,\" and \"Tower of God.\" Both of which are what I would consider legitimate masterpieces. Needless to say, I shit my pants. The fact that this webtoon was rated up there with titles like berserk, vagabond, and kingdom is kind of jarring. Trust me that in this review I am pushing all of that aside to give an honest and objective view of this webtoon. I have since reread it for the sake of accuracy. So, here we go. Keep in mind that I will refer to SL to as an Isekai for lack of a better word, and for the fact that it shares many plot elements. Here, isekai will be used as the name of a comic where the main character gets strong fast. Story (5): The story is ok. It follows the tried and true formula of making a weaker character become stronger in order to provide the reader the excitement of watching them grow faster than other characters in the story. Trust me, when I read my first isekai in the form of \"Dungeon Seeker\" way back in 2016, I was just as excited about it as people are with this title. There is something about this kind of story that just makes people completely ignore any substance the story may or may not have. I have since admitted to myself that \"Dungeon Seeker\" is terrible. And the more times I read this kind of story, the less I enjoy it. It was for this reason that when I read Solo Leveling for the first time that I was not amused at all. Beneath all the badassery is a lack of real character development. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS SOLO LEVELING'S WEAKEST POINT: In the first chapter, it states how the main character WILL become the strongest S ranked hunter in the universe of Solo Leveling, which lowers possible character development in terms of strength. So... there is still room for emotional development. Nope. The main character remains calm in situations, is smart, cares about people who are close to him, is motivated, etc. The character development here is the he gets more chill and edgy. By telling the reader that the MC will become powerful, there really is no kind of character development left that would give the story substance. Furthermore, the leveling system, similar to that of video game statistics and seen in many of the isekai genre, is used as a substitute for character development, as the reader can tangibly see how much the character has grown. Now, I admit that SL is different than other isekai in terms of the fact that none of the other characters can see their own stats. But the reader can roughly compare characters using the more widely used class system where hunters are ranked using a letter, with S being the highest and E being the lowest. As for the dialogue, it is at times atrocious, in the first chapter there is a scene where two men are talking about the main character, and one asks the other the same question rephrased for about 2 pages. This is way to blatant to be a translation error. Having read many other korean manhwa and webtoon, I strongly believe that this dialogue is in fact part of the original pre translated webtoon. Another thing that sucks is that all exposition in the story is stuffed down the reader's throats. Whether it be by gossiping men talking about the main character, through dudes explaining the rules of the world to people who should already know, it almost never happens naturally. The story really treats the reader like a baby, and I don't like it. Despite the character development and dialogue, I do believe that the story is better than that of other isekai. Many in this genre feature characters that get endlessly stronger without actually introducing any conflict in the story after the prologue. I applaud Solo Leveling for setting itself apart from the rest in this very crucial way. The mc is still getting stronger, but we have been introduced to some strong enemies so in this way, Solo Leveling gets a pass. The flow of the story is really good as well, it’s very easy to read. Characters (6): Characters in this are pretty generic personality wise, especially female ones. There are some interesting ones tho, and designs are pretty cool. I think its cool that there is more of an ensemble cast than I would have thought would be in something like this, especially one called \"Solo Leveling.\" But there isn't enough real substance to justify a higher score here. Art (9): Looks great, fight scenes are great. The shadow dudes look especially great. The effects shown are really immersive, and it has great choreography. Panels are well placed to great effect. Character designs are all great and unique, but sometimes contribute greatly to the edgy tone that drives some criticism of the webtoon. Doesn't bother me much but i'll take a point away. Enjoyment (8): Its very exciting to read, and the art adds to the hype factor of the scenes. I am a very critical person so I can't in good conscience give anything other than the art a full score unless I legitimately thought the story was good:) Overall (6): It’s good, but not great, definitely doesn't deserve all it's hype, and it only halfway deserves it's hate. I definitely don’t like it’s placement on the list because I don’t like it being the first thing people see when they look at manga as opposed to other greats. But I guess it could be an okay entry point. This is one of the most popular webtoon at the moment, and I'm sure that there are plenty of other manga/manhwa/manhua that are overrated/underrated on her so I guess it’s fine."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Solo leveling is probably for readers who really like a badass character where to the point he's unbeatable.

It feels like he's character become nothing throughout the arcs, There's no lesson in every fighting scenes he done, It just the only thing he can do is being strong. ... As a fan oh shounen and manga where it the character is really developing, it frustrates me to see this manhwa. When I'm reading it, it bores me to death because y'all ready know what will happen, because the mc can't be defeat to every opponent he fights. He fights and he's getting stronger and stronger to the point that it's not interesting at all. I wish that on his way, there's actually a developing stage where he really needs to be stronger by tasting defeat, of course, he taste defeat when he's a weak person but now that it's just really boring and just his personality is \"becoming stronger\". And it frustrate me that he's just really fighting, no plan or really has the 'difficult' stage that he experiences, it like his opponents is piece of cake that it's not really fun to read. I do want a mc that is really strong but not like this where the character is plain like rice. It's just has a weak story plot, I don't think that the story is very interesting at all, probably the one who saves this manhwa is the artsyle on how outstanding it is, but for the story, I'll just probably read metamorphosis then this.

Look ending does matter a lot to a franchise. A good ending can make a mediocre or trash series liked by fans. Similarly a bad ending can make a good or great story ... turn out to be utter trash. Art: This is probably the best part of this manhwa. Some panels are really admirable and character designs are really great. Story: Story itself is like flipping a biased coin. We know who is gonna win but we will read it anyway. There aren’t many plot twists and turns in the story itself. Story was never like we were expecting something great anyway but it was like Sung Jin-Woo is gonna kick some ass and kill some enemies. The concept of OP MC itself is not bad either but it needs to be done in a right way that it can make it less predictable for the readers. So now the rant for ending: The ending itself isn’t bad actually but it’s just too feels so much underwhelming. I won’t care if they would have same conclusion to this in a better way. So the Final arc was about Monarch of Destruction vs Sun Jin-Woo . I was really excited for this battle and battle itself was great. But the build up for this arc was something too good when they explained the story rulers vs Monarchs it was really great. And the shadow monarch story itself was good. But for some reason Author decided to make Rulers fucking useless. He introduced a new character basically for nothing and puts all the hype for the antagonist down to the vain. And you introduce something new as time travel in second last chapter of the manhwa is like an ultimate bruh moment. SL ending is just nothing literally nothing had been concluded from ending it’s neither happy nor sad. It is nothing. Many people would say it’s like TG RE. But TG RE had proper conclusion to every character. Characters : Cast of SL is actually big but just starts with Sung Jin woo and ends with him. Supporting characters and antagonists in the manhwa are actually for nothing. They just becomes nerfed after an arc. They didn’t have any backstories or something like that. Antagonists in this manhwa are like not really exciting tbh bc we know who is gonna win anyway. Enjoyment: Ya I really enjoyed but this manhwa in general but this feels food without spice it is not gonna taste well if it isn’t fully prepared or completed properly."}, {"score": "10", "content": "This manhwa is a masterpiece everything is perfect. We told me the chapter 155 was the last and I was desperate but turns out it will continue. Story: The fact that he levels up like in video games is so good the scenario is a jewel! There is battle, adventure, discovery. Wholesale it's a man that is a hunter and is the worst of them all. But then there's a twist. Art: I've been taking more screen shot than reading the webtoon plus colors are lit. My phone and laptop wallpaper are Sung jin-woo. No need more. ... Character: Characters have extraordinary design, abilities and story. You get easily attached to each of them. Powers, weapons it's the best of all.

The story sounds generic but its anything but that, at first i thought ohh cool another series about a dude getting stronger but unlike shows that make the character OP ... this series shows the progress of his leveling and the hardships he goes through unlike series that just go oh now he is op soo he cant lose and end it like that. really good a solid 10/10 Def recommend it"}, {"score": "10", "content": "This manga really surprised me because I would always think oh its some average Isekai but in my opinion after reading around 80 chapters of this it really isn't. It combines both worlds as living in current day Korea but having dungeons normalized into society and having jobs as Hunters via guilds, long story short it's the real world with real people with dungeons and monsters in it. I'm really enjoying this right now. It has some combinations into the story with DanMachi and sorta with the Hidden Dungeon only I can enter they just both come up to mind when thinking about the plots. The ... story is really interesting from the start, it might be basic but it just gives a different vibe from other shows/manga's stories. It gives detailed descriptions about the organizations, the layout, and how it's directed. You can't really leave this manga after you read the first couple of chapters but it might get you in the first half if you get what I'm saying, it's called Solo Leveling for a reason. It progresses over time. The art is relaxing and enjoyable to look at, it's in color as well which is even better and shows how much detail they put into this. I could honestly read this for hours without getting tired of it but I want to split it up and not just finish it all in one go. Honestly I really loved the characters especially the main character because he changes so much in this and it surprises me even though it might look generic he still struggles on some occasions. He's an absolute badass in most scenes and it's just awesome to see it. They showed plenty of characters over this including side and characters that are just used for the chapter/plot which gives insight of what their life was and gives detailed explanations about each one. Their designs are drawn really well so shout out to the creators for this. This is a must recommend in my opinion, there's a reason it's one of the most read manga's out there.

I dont think I need to talk much about art, ... as I used multiple panels from this manhwa as my background on mobile and PC, every battle being better drawn than previous one. This series had many characters that I loved, either them being comical relief , or emotional support to Jin-Woo, they were all well done, but there are also many characters that we loved in the beginning , who get almost no focus as time passes.

Solo Leveling is a manhwa (Korean manga) that started publishing in 2018 and has recently ended in 2021. It follows Jinwoo, who has the unfortunate epithet “the World’s Weakest” due to his lack of strength and power as a Hunter. However, this all changes on one fateful day when he joins in on a seemingly normal raid. I think I was recommended to read this, and I’ve heard great things about it, so I was compelled to read Solo Leveling! This is also my first “zero to hero” story, so I approached it with fresh eyes. The story was, ... quite simply, epic. The author did an incredible job with world-building and making sure that the plot flowed smoothly. Following along Jinwoo as he practically becomes a god wasn’t as predictable as you think it would be. His journey was thoroughly enjoyable to read. The art was also amazing to look at. From the talking portions to the battle scenes, everything was beautifully drawn, and supplements the story well. Despite the wide range of characters in Solo Leveling, each character was well-developed. I enjoyed how the author thoroughly thought out the characters’ personalities, histories, designs, etc. Each character, including the minor ones, stands out.

It is one of those MUST READ!!! I don't usually write reviews , unless it is worth expressing my true feelings XD So here comes my attempt to not spoil everything but make you interested in readig it) Story I get that first 10 chapters are kinda hard to get over, but after that the most interesting part beggins. And even if this is one of those OP characters stories , it is a lot more captivating than many others you've read. This manhwa has absolutely everything you need. Action , adventure , ... supernatural powers , magic (good and bad) , fantasy a weak to strong Main character , social life , secrets and breaking of rules , dungeons and very interesting moves and actions from all the characters involved. So the main story line is MAIN CHARACTER developing his skills and becoming more powerful. It was such an intense reading how he was becoming who he is now at chapter 110. Even his appearance has changed , he absolutely DEVELOPED. This is what I like the most about it. And moreover , he is not stupidly boasting about it to everyone around. But instead he is kinda stealthy and descreet about his actions. The only thing I didn't like about the story SPOILER AHEAD!!! was the chapter about insects island. Which sounded a lot like HunrterXHunter stolen idea XD. Or maybe this was just a coincidence that the enemies were also insects XD *** So this is why I gave the story a 9 instead of a VERY HARD 10.

It has a lot of pretty effects and the QUALITY is absolutely astonishing . Expecially the blue and black flame - shadow thing I ABSOLUTELY ADORE IT <3 Characters Well. People might think a lot different than me - but I liked every single character - even the villains) They all have their inner world and a story to tell. And every single one has a truth that they believe in , so I deeply care about every single one. Overall SO It is just my advice - Just try to read it.

I had many doubts when my brother recommended this to me but within the first 30 minutes I could not stop reading. The premise is bout your below average MC tryna make it big in the world full of 'hunters\". These hunters are task to raid dungeons fight monsters and etc. The stronger the hunter the higher rank. Our MC is the lowest rank thus making him the weakest hunter. How he gets to the top is what this whole show is about. Story wise I feel as though solo leveling was good. I mean its nothing ... out of this world and does have your typical manhwa OP character level ups. However if you enjoy this then its definitely for you. If you don't then don't read it. Besides if there is a sequel i'm curious to see where the story is going as well as how good the world building is within that sequel. For the most part solo leveling did a really good job with world building. My only complaint is how they kinda copied hunter x hunter in a way. While not necessarily a complaint I thought it was kinda funny how they did it. Story- 8/10 Not gonna say much about manhwa art. The fact that it is all colored makes it even better. For the most part its flashy has good style and every character looks and feels different. Not to mention the amazing fight scenes, power ups, attention to detail and did i mention the character designs? Guys this is art and its beautiful. Art- 9/10 Characters in solo leveling. Where do I start? Our MC is pretty freaking amazing. Not gonna lie while he does start of weak how he develops as the story progresses was done pretty well. There is a reason its called solo leveling. While he does get help its all other his own powers. Side characters on the other hand i kinda feel this is the weak part of the whole series. For one I kinda feel S rank hunters are the only things to look forward to in this show everyone else is kinda meh. On a side note the characters aren't bad but do lack depth in a sense. Im only giving this an 8 cause they wrote a pretty good MC. Characters- 8/10 One word badassery Enjoyment- 10/10 A lot of better things to read if you want a deep story, deeper characters, slightly better art.

The main character is super overpowered, super handsome, with plenty of waifus into him (including an S-rank Hunter). This is your stereotypical shounen isekai (well, not really, it's set on Earth) battle fantasy, and I say that in the best way possible. It isn't deep or ... meaningful. It is quick, cheap entertainment in the purest form. That being said, there is a plot. There's supposedly an explanation for the Hunters and why our MC is so overpowered. There is a sense of mystery that's slowly revealed as the story goes on. The plot isn't randomly sidelined with filler, and is pretty interesting in and of itself. There's good worldbuilding. Other countries are mentioned, and there are realistic organizations and regulations surrounding the Hunters. It's interesting just seeing how other countries deal with things.

The theme throughout the story is loose some time and nonexistent other times. The story itself feels very jarring their seems to be almost no traditions between the different arcs. The story itself is very straightforward witch has some advantages however this makes the story seem strangely familiar, which is not inherently ... bad however this at times creates an environment of predictability and makes the story more boring than it would be otherwise. Art-10 The art is extremely good Character-9 the charters are pretty well developed and time was but in later on to make the enemies have more motivation and less mindless monsters. The only issue is a lot of the charters lack a needed extra level of complexity to move them to the next level. Enjoyment-10 despite my criticisms of this story, I enjoyed every minute of reading it. This is mostly because of the amazing fight scenes combined with the very good charters. In just about every fight throughout the story, my heart was raising, This is the most fun I had reading anything in a long time and I read just about the entire thing for about 2 days.

So I like that the author decided no to be lazy and make the MC op but always hiding his strength. In some manga/hwa/hua hiding your strength is advantageous but in most, it's not. Also, I like the fact ... that he didn't go full zero-hero and actually had many challenging quests and not to mention the fact he still isn't OP and has many enemies that can fuck him up.

I never thought a story based on an overpowering character could be so good. I will 100% re-read it and enjoy it. I was mesmerized almost immediately with the story. At first I was a bit worried we might get a character like the guy from Katekyou Hitman Reborn, the always lame guy, but he turned out just fine. He reminded me of the main character from Parasyte the Maxim. They had a (sort of) similar story in some regards, what with their personality changing once they gained power and becoming ‘less human’ ... so to speak. I got the same vibe from Jiwoon (and I loved that too since Parasyte the Maxim is one of my favorite anime). There was also that detail about their mothers getting burned by mistake while trying to protect their sons (I remember there was a detail like that in Parasyte the Maxim as well). But the similarities are still feeble and it’s mostly me who wants to dwell on them. Jiwoon isn’t a copycat, he’s a super good character who stands by himself. I loved his evolution and I think I might have fallen in love with him a little bit, as had everybody else in the story. He’s super cool. I liked that he was also attached to his family and friends and he would put them first, as it befits a hero. There was this resistance towards the world (putting his family and himself first, getting stronger for their own good, and not for the world), but that dissipated at the end. Since he had to protect everyone. I can’t find something I found poorly made/drawn, to be honest, I think it was an amazingly good webtoon, well written, superbly drawn and with extreme good character-building (which is so important to this type of story). It’s 10/10 for me from almost all points of view. I’m not so sure about the added chapters at the end — they were a bit mellow and I was disappointed with the ending. But that’s on me, I saw it coming for a while and I knew broadly how it was going to happen. There were enough hints in regards with the big picture. But I suppose I just do bad with that type of an ending — I wanted the entire world to know he was a hero and I wanted the original setting to remain. But Jiwoon has always been clear on this regard. He was a guy who cared deeply about his family and friends. So it was natural he would sacrifice any glory on their behalf. Some would say it was on his own behalf too, since it benefitted him in the end as well. He could finally lead a closer to normal life, without danger. But I get the feeling it wasn’t just that. He was a damn cool hero and though I have mixed feelings about the ending (and very personal feelings, let’s get straight), I can see it was drawn finely and I have no objective problems with it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I firmly believe that Solo Leveling deserves a 9.50/10 manga rating.

It is fascinating to watch his journey, which is full of thrilling fights and a constant sense of him pushing himself to the limit. For those who appreciate a good underdog story, I highly recommend this one. I was intrigued by the series for the most part due to its intricate plot, but the conclusion left me unsatisfied. It felt like the entire journey culminated in a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion. Rather than ... following a logical development, the narrative chose to leap to an entirely different realm. I was annoyed by this since it meant saying goodbye to the characters I had become attached to throughout the narrative. It was very lacking in emotional payoff. It was like discarding every relationship that had been built in favor of a marginally different situation. Having said that, I recognize the author's intentions. The manga's clear writing style keeps the reader from becoming bogged down in pointless exposition. Maybe that was supposed to be the quick, similar resolution at the end. So, the final verdict? Solo Leveling is an amazing manga with a compelling plot and a strong sense of suspense. But brace yourself for what may turn out to be a lackluster ending. Solo Leveling is well worth reading for fans of fantasy, action, and magic, especially those who appreciate a good underdog story. However, keep in mind the warning. If you are expecting the ending that you believe it will be, you should probably set your expectations lower.

In my case, I'm conflicted about this series and can't quite recommend it wholeheartedly for reasons I shall outline below. I like to start my reviews with the best parts of a series, so let's dive straight into that. The art is absolutely amazing. Whether it's action scenes or regular dialogue scenes, every panel is filled with high-quality art. I would attribute a large part of this manhwa's success to the amazing artwork. It's a treat to the eyes. Aside from the art style, there is little I can truly recommend about Solo Leveling. But I do feel that ... the way Solo Leveling used its pacing works quite well, and especially the struggles the main character Sung Jin-woo faces in the beginning really pull the reader in. Unfortunately, this feeling fades quickly. If you're looking for a power fantasy story, Solo Leveling should be right up your alley. That’s because Sung Jin-woo is a special snowflake who keeps on getting stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and….. you get the point. That’s the entirety of Solo Leveling in a nutshell – he fights something that’s slightly too strong for him but wins by pulling a new ability out of his ass and levels up after he makes the kill. The way he levels up and the game mechanics he discovers are still pretty interesting at the start, but because the same formula gets used over and over it really loses its punch after a while. Sung Jin-woo also never needs to use any smarts to win, it’s always brute force or an overpowered cheat ability. Let’s move on to the characters, relationships and worldbuilding. The main character has little to no personality. Neither do the side characters. Sure, they all have some sort of role to play in relation to the world or Sung Jin-woo, and I guess there’s some sort of bond between them. But these characters still don’t matter in the end. And that’s because Sung Jin-woo will solve everything for everyone with his sheer overwhelming strength. It makes these side characters, who cannot grow in strength like him, completely irrelevant. Which is a shame, because a few of these people seemed like they could have been much more interesting. As far as worldbuilding goes, I won’t even bother trying to go into that. Suffice to say, there isn’t much. In the end, I did enjoy myself with Solo Leveling. But that’s only because I did my best to focus on the good points (the art) while desperately trying to ignore the bad points (everything else)."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Solo Leveling, a manhwa with some good but mostly bad. There will be no spoilers in this review. Good - Art. As most other manhwa, the art is good. The colors used, the world design, all of them were way better than most manga out there. Character Design - The monster designs in this manhwa are also good but nothing to special. Although, the monsters themselves were pretty generic. Apart from monsters, the human characters although have very generic manhwa design but they are pleasant to see. Bad - Story - Now this is where things get messy. Unlike most other manhwas, it is still somewhat on linear trajectory ... plot wise till end of Season1(which in my view is a big feat for manhwa) but the plot itself is way too mediocre and some arcs and elements are straight rip off from some famous mangas out there. Like most other action mahwa, very soon everything starts to revolve around main protagonist which in my opinion makes the story more bland with each passing chapter. Due to this, the manhwa feels more like a wishful fanfiction rather than a flashed out story. Character Development - Another bad thing about this manhwa and most manhwas in general, there is very little character development. The only character development is that of main protagonist and that too is very limited. The plot so far is so focused on protagonist that it ignores every character in the manhwa. Infact other than MC all other characters are used as props whose only job is to either get awed by MC's god like powers or to praise him to the moon. This flaw is very common in manhwa format and damages both plot and quality of manhwa. My rating for this manhwa is 6/10. In the beginning, the manhwa looked bit promising but it starts to become bland and generic in mid way. People might like this type of work due to its light novel background and isekai feel which are currently rage amongst the fanbase but in my opinion this is nothing more than an average fanfiction which got its manhwa adaptation.

I had so much fun reading it and you could see it had potential. Unfortunately, that's everything it had to offer for me, the more the series moved on, the more dull it got. Everything started getting more ... and more repetitive, the conflicts started being resolved always in the same ways, and also the drawings started having a lot of repeated poses and panels, the stakes got lower and lower the more the main character grew in strength, and what was hype at the beginning started being boredom for me. The main character started well, but his psychological growth stopped at like 1/3 of the series. He became a character with no flaws and that's something I personally don't enjoy. The supporting cast got very little characterization since the main focus was always on the mc. The villains were all very flat and never explored enough, and ironically the stronger they were the less menacing they felt. As for the story, I enjoyed the first half with all the mysteries unsolved, but as soon as they were solved it kinda lost my interest.

Though, when I read the manhwa, it quickly dawned on me that the author had zero intention to develop anything that made the first two episodes mildly intriguing. Nonetheless, I ran through a whopping 129 (!!!) chapters, knowing it would suck, out of boredom - then I thought \"Why not write a short review summarizing my own bad life decisions?\".

Some might say the story was unnecessarily hyped up despite its simplicity, but it's really just a manga that does the generic male op power fantasy simple and well. It has good characters, sometimes overshadowed (no pun intended) by the MC, but the interactions and story of each one of them is enough to like them. The story is enjoyable, the fight panels are awesome and very action-packed, the antagonists feel a little bit too generic but well executed, and I ... like the little funny interactions between Jinwoo and his shadows. One thing I won't ever understand is why there is a need to make an MC like him always become apathetic and edgy as he becomes more powerful (I know there's an explanation for this because of his new heart and the shadow monarch powers and whatnot, but for me it felt too rushed). As for the main love interest, I think they executed it pretty well and didn't feel forced at all unlike some other stories, although I would've preferred if he ended up with Lee Joohee since their connection from the start already seemed genuine and felt like it was supposed to go somewhere, unlike Cha Hae-In that seems to fall for him just because he saved her and doesn't smell awful to her like the other hunters. Overall, it was a good read with a nice flow of story and decent characters, perfect if you want to take your mind off other complex manga stories and just watch a man aura farm his way from zero to god level. 9/10"}, {"score": "10", "content": "\"Solo Leveling\" is a South Korean manhwa (comic) series written by Chu-Gong and illustrated by Jang Sung-Rak. The story follows the journey of Sung Jin-Woo, a low-ranked hunter who gains the ability to level up like a video game character after a mysterious incident. He uses his newfound powers to embark on a dangerous quest to save humanity from supernatural threats. The artwork in \"Solo Leveling\" is breathtaking, with intricate and detailed character designs and vibrant, action-packed battle scenes. The author and artist do an excellent job of conveying the intensity and scale of the fights, making it easy to feel the weight of the characters' ... actions. One of the strengths of \"Solo Leveling\" is its world-building. The series takes place in a complex and intricate fantasy world, with its own mythology, politics, and social structures. The story is expertly crafted, with a well-paced narrative that slowly reveals more about the world and its characters over time. The character development in \"Solo Leveling\" is also noteworthy. Sung Jin-Woo's growth as a character is gradual but meaningful, as he learns to master his powers and become a more formidable hunter. The supporting characters are also well-developed, with their own distinct personalities and motivations that make them feel like real people. One potential downside of \"Solo Leveling\" is its reliance on certain tropes and clichés common in the fantasy genre, such as the overpowered protagonist and the secretive mentor figure. Some readers may find these elements to be predictable or unoriginal. Overall, \"Solo Leveling\" is a must-read for fans of the fantasy and action genres. Its stunning artwork, intricate world-building, and well-developed characters make it a standout in the genre, and its gripping narrative will keep readers on the edge of their seats."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Although I typically enjoy reading romance manga/manhwa, Solo Leveling has captured my attention in a unique way. It's not the type of manhwa that I would usually read, but its fast-paced and dynamic plot has me eagerly waiting for each new chapter every other week. The story's action, violence, mystery, and role-playing elements are far from my usual preference, but somehow Solo Leveling manages to keep me engaged and wanting more. To comprehend the plot of Solo Leveling, one must first understand the world in which the story takes place. This world is similar to ours, except that it has been under attack by monsters for ... a long time. These monsters try to invade the world by creating cells that must be eliminated before they can reach the surface. To fight back, the Hunter's Association was created, where several people participate in combat. Our protagonist, Sung Jinwoo, is one of the weakest hunters in the guild. He fights to earn money for his sick mother and his younger sister, who is still studying. One day, he enters a dungeon with a strong group, unaware that his experience there will change the entire game. Solo Leveling is a fast-paced read, with a dynamic plot that encourages readers to devour the volume in a short time and eagerly anticipate the next chapters. The story begins by introducing Sung Jinwoo and the world of the Hunter's Association, gradually immersing readers in the dungeon and surprising them with what they find there. The vignettes are laid out in a style that is easy to follow, with an average of two or three per page and full color. This, along with the few dialogues, creates a dynamic reading experience, especially at the end of each chapter. As the story progresses, the script evolves into a tale that resembles a video game, making it equally addictive. The second volume, in particular, completely changes the dynamics and allows readers to better understand the world created for the manhwa and the changes that Sung Jinwoo undergoes. To avoid spoiling the story's secrets and adding to the enjoyment of reading Solo Leveling, I will not provide more details. However, if you are looking for a story that includes action, violence, mystery, role-playing, and even some love, Solo Leveling is an excellent choice."}, {"score": "10", "content": "It took me a re-read to realize, just how valid the term \"Solo Peak\" truly is.

This made me change my rating from an 8/10 at first-read, to a 10/10 on the second. Now, avoiding spoilers is going to be difficult here, so I'll keep it brief: The revelations made throughout the series take it far beyond just your average power fantasy... Sung Jin-Woo may not seem like all that special of a character, but as ... most will come to realize, he feels like a real person - his reactions to what happens around him feels *real*. What would you do, given the power to become infinitely strong? Level up, of course - but would you want to be the hero of the world, or save the people you care about? I find that Sung Jin-Woo is a realistic, yet fantastical character. But the greatness of this series does not stop at sung Jin-woo... The world-building is very intricate, and introduces us to a diverse cast of characters. While it may feel like the world surrounds the MC, it just makes sense in the context of this world... Hunters ranking from E to S, but their power is set in stone? Of course it would shake the world that someone with infinite potential *arises*. I could go on for a while, but I would be spoiling.

Additionally, all of the shadows he controls grow into distinct and often funny side characters. These characters, however, directly counteract the title \"solo\" levelling, as apart from the beginning few chapters, he is almost always 'group' levelling.

Despite how generic it may seem story wise because of the massive influx of returnee and awakener stories, this one just stands out to me as a cut above the rest, and its superb ... art helps it stand out as a cut above the rest. My only real nitpick for it is that I can find it kinda frustrating at times the lengths Mister Woo will go to remain low-key, and it can get him into preventable trouble and even despite the times he shows off his strength and the notoriety he achieves people still downplay or doubt him at times, and it kinda makes me want to screech in disbelief at the absurd lengths the author will go to push the plot along with that. There honestly isn't much to say about the story, it is pretty cut and paste, but the scenes and hype remain pretty epic in story when things go down. If you enjoy these types of stories, then I highly recommend it. If not, stay away. Very far away, no amount of hype and great art will make up for the lack of creativity in the writing.

The story was a 10/10. From what i heard it follows the LN well and improves it greatly with the art and the fight scenes. The art is a 10/10.

Well, you'll have to find it out. Trust me, if i didn't watch the movie, i would have had difficulties stomaching this.

As i was saying, the story is unique, if compared to japanese mangas, that's why i liked it. To be honest, i was getting bored of Demon Lords, and many more, but that depends on how is the character. Speaking of character, Sung Jinwoo is badass, but he's kind too. He has deep care for his family, like putting priority on saving his little sister, being a hunter to pay for the mom's medical bill. As for other characters, Go Gunhee is a pretty good character, so is the Guild Masters of the Top Five Guild in Korea, The Japanese S-Ranks, The Guys who was with Sung Jinwoo when he was in the double dungeon, the Nurse who saw him exercising with no shirt on and asked for his number, Cha Hae-in, and many more.

After an incident in the dungeon, he got a special kind of power and he started to use it to became stronger. This MC really adapted well to the situation and started using his power to the maximum. He wasn’t weak anymore. He developed after experiencing a situation ... which forced him to be strong. It might seem the typical overpowered MC that you saw in a lot of other Manga but nobody is as epic as this guy. This kind of plot you can see in the countless Korean Manhwas and Novels but for me, the MC is the main reason why I like this so much. As for the other characters, I must say they blended well with the story. We met some funny ones, some arrogant and then we also saw cute and strong girls and that’s a plus. The one problem I have is that the author has tendencies to forget some characters. For me, that wasn’t something that bothered me that much but still, it would be good to sometimes know what are they doing. The one thing other than MC that brought Solo Leveling to other dimension is Art. The art in this Manhwa is just AMAZING, it isn't just epic, is cool, beautiful...

Predictable fights Even though many of them try to create a different approach, the very concept, characters and the progression of the manhwa fails to hide these elements and thus they become \"generic from unique\" at some point of the story. Solo levellings concept did create a successful unique approach with a good potential to present a great manhwa. ... The main character who is weak but full of determination to fight and struggle, well written characters, antagonists, support characters etc etc is what readers want to see mostly in stories that fall in \"weak but i want to get stronger\" criteria.

Even though these kind of artstyles have become quite common in modern manhwa industry. Solo levelling did have the potential to turn into a great story. It had all those elememts to create hype, add an unique perspective for this kind of rpg based plots, quite enjoyable. BUT. Things go downfall after 30 or so chapters. All these hypes and stuff u feel quietly vanishes away as u read further. The story goes from \"unique\" to \"generic\". From a determined mc we see a him turn into an Over powered, badass character fighting and winning every time, no threats, struggles, potential antagonists, development scope. Basically it turned out to be a recycled rpg. Theres nothing unique or even good left now at this point of the story rather than the artstyles which obviously made the manhwa get more attention the it deserves. And if we just care about the visuals and throw away the plot, progression, the characters development then we can easily rate it 9. But in the end of the day the story has turned \" GENERIC\" Still theres some hope left as the manhwa is still ongoing and there are some clues in recent chapters that the story might get better than its current state.

Other than that there also seems to be a mystery about what the system is and why it gave him the ability to keep going up. Combat is fun and sometimes they use a few strategies, so they are not boring. The art is great, the background, the characters and especially the enemies look fantastic. The characters are the least remarkable, most are impressed by Jin-Woo's power or underestimate it, they have almost ... no deep development, yet most are nice, like Yoo Jin-Ho. The main character is intelligent and changes slightly as he levels up, becoming perhaps a little conceited and cold, which is a little edgy, adding that in most of the panels you only see one eye shining in blue, something cringey but passable. In spite of having several weak points, when you start reading it you start getting more and more interested in everything that happens and how it happens, or at least that was my case. (Spoiler) Actually the only time I felt some boredom was in the fight against the super evolved ant. In short, it's definitely not a masterpiece, but the fights, the art, the way in which the story and the protagonist's overpower are handled, make it an outstanding zero to hero series.

There is a lot of wasted potential for character growth and deeper exploration of their personality. The only person who ... changes is the MC and in a very typical from zero to cool guy way. 6 Enjoyment... a solid 9. It's a very, very fun read with nice twists inside the story. The way the MC fights is nicely thought of and is not just about power levels and being stronger.

It more or less does everything that your average isekai does, but with great art and good internal consistency. Most things that happen in the world make sense, and there aren't very many asspulls or totally out of character things that happen. That being said, the manhwa itself isn't very deep or ambitious, it's a somewhat standard fare of just saving the world and gaining power, but in some respects, it's also better for that. I would rather read a manhwa or manga that succeeds at what it's aiming for rather than one that shoots ... too far and misses.

The art is amazing, the best thing out of it by far is the art, so much shocking scenes potrayed in the manhwa, taht being said the story is decent at best and the characters are just okay, literally some of the best characters were just side characters. Solo leveling is easy to digest in the start but the later it goes things get more complex and confuse, but it's worth a shot if you have the time for it, but I don't think it's even close to being one of the best manhwa there is around, in my opinion if you like systems you probably would prefer Omniscient Reader Viewpoint, which has all good points of solo leveling, but without the flaws it has, that being said you could enjoy reading both.

The story was going really well and it just kept getting better, until I reach the last arc that is. The end of the arc was pretty much rushed and during the fight Sung Jin Woo randomly gets a power up (and still barely wins). After this he ... made those jesus looking people use the cup of reincarnation to save everyone he lost which was actually a good decision. Now the ending, on the other hand, was actually pretty good.

A disclaimer if you continue reading, you can't unread the worst ending of a story in your whole life, the ending of the story is equivalent as ass, a proper example of shit. Now enough about the ending lets talk about the whole story now, the story is about a guy who used to be worst hunter in existing to being the best, the journey is surreal and splendid but the fact that he is tooo overpowered is a meh. Also in other animes with the same plot struggles a lot in becoming the best but here in solo leveling there were no struggles. The mc was sooo overpowered that he was E rank went past D, C, B, A and S rank hunters it'd be alright if the writer would let the mc be in par with S rank hunters for a while but no the moment he became S rank he sky rocketed and surpassed them in few days, also even after becoming a national level hunter it didnt take him two days to surpass them as well. It's like the writer didnt want the story to be long for some reason, if they would made the story a bit longer and had given more screentime to other potential characters like Cha Hae-In, Sung Il-Hwan, Go Gun-Hee,Jin ho and other S rank hunters who try to recruit hunter sung jin woo funny ways but fail miserably, the person who deserved the most screen time was Cha Hae-In she and sung jin woo couldve had a relationship going if only they had given her an enough screentime also they didnt show the progression of the guild ahjin instead of making it a two man team with sung jin woo and jin ho only sung couldve added more hunters to his guild and made it bigger fairly (by fairly i mean there is a rule they need to follow in order to create a guild and raid along with them) even if he thinks that more hunters equals more risk then he could just let them clear low grade gates or just let them be behind him as backup or something, idk it just wasnt it.

And I’m not saying it’s bad by any means. But please for the love of god. Give this man a challenge. I actually had Solo Leveling at an 8 before the most recent chapter and that was for good reasons. Outstanding art, a cool power system, and a interesting world with a lot of mystery surrounding it. My main issue with Solo Leveling is the antagonists, or more accurately the lack of them. For the first fifty chapters or so the challenges our protagonist is faced with were an actual plot point and he had to ... work to overcome them. A hundred or so chapters later and we have probably the most hyped up antagonist in the series, Thomas Andre, get stomped out by our edge lord in just a couple of pages. I know that I for one was hoping for an actual CHALLENGE for Sung Jin-Woo but I guess I should have expected less. To put it in simpler terms he’s just too overpowered. Hunter Sung Jin-Woo doesn’t even feel like a protagonist at this point. Because you know that no one in the series can stand up to him. And if they try they’ll probably get one shot or something because of his Kirito levels of edgyness. I thought this was supposed to be about someone coming from the bottom and working himself up but that’s not the case at all. Hunter Sung Jin-Woo had already reached the pinnacle of his abilities around 80 or so chapters in. And the Meruem copy that was supposed to be the strongest mother fucker out there? Didn’t even pose a threat. To wrap things up nicely I don’t hate solo leveling. It’s some of the most beautiful artwork I’ve read in manwha but the rest of it just doesn’t add up. I sincerely hope that moving forward, the plot will actually go in a clear direction. Because right now, it just feels like I’m watching a RPG game where the player has already beaten the game and is just steamrolling low level enemies to have fun. -Harry"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Solo Leveling is undeniably one of the most enthralling manhwa series out there, and for good reason. What truly sets it apart is its ability to weave together a compelling narrative with breathtaking artwork and intricate character development. First and foremost, the plot of Solo Leveling is a rollercoaster of excitement and intrigue. Following the journey of Sung Jin-Woo, a low-ranked hunter who discovers the power to level up in a world teeming with monsters, the story hooks readers from the get-go. Each chapter unfolds with meticulous attention to detail, unveiling a complex and immersive storyline that keeps you eagerly turning the pages. Visually, Solo Leveling is ... a feast for the eyes. The artwork is nothing short of spectacular, with meticulously drawn characters, dynamic action sequences, and atmospheric backgrounds that transport you directly into the heart of the story. Every panel is a work of art in its own right, enhancing the overall experience and immersing readers in the world of hunters and dungeons. Moreover, the characters in Solo Leveling are incredibly well-developed and multifaceted. Sung Jin-Woo's journey of self-discovery and growth is both compelling and relatable, as he transforms from a timid protagonist into a formidable warrior. The supporting cast is equally engaging, each with their own unique personalities and motivations that add depth and richness to the narrative. Of course, it wouldn't be Solo Leveling without its epic battles. From intense one-on-one duels to epic showdowns against hordes of monsters, the series delivers adrenaline-pumping action scenes that leave you on the edge of your seat. The meticulously choreographed fights not only showcase the characters' strengths and abilities but also serve to advance the plot and raise the stakes even higher. In conclusion, Solo Leveling is a masterpiece of the manhwa medium. With its stunning artwork, and well-developed characters, it's no wonder that it has captured the hearts and imaginations of readers worldwide.

I think it gets that score because its easy to read and ignore all the faults that are really dragging this manwha's quality down. These faults are The Charachters (3/10): The main character, sung jin-woo is kinda bland but he has some really cool \"edgy\" moments most of those are in the earlier sections of this story but he has some bad ass moments throughout. He also had some moments where he made me chuckle. Other than that he's not too interesting beyond his OP'ness. The other ... charachters in this manwha aren't worth the tasks of remembering their names which is already kinda hard for someone who has this as their first manwha (like me) because the names are korean. They basically only serve the purpose of praising the MC's power from around half way through the story . Chae hae-in, the only other character whos name i remember is only memeorable because shes supposed the love interest. The Story: (3/10) The narrative is rather nebulous the MC has a goal which i wont say for spoilers but its not very captivating or even prevelant all he really does is grind. There are some questions about some one charachter that got me interested but they werent really touched on in this first season of this manwha. The last arc is pretty ok tho. The Art:(10/10) This is definetly the selling point of the manwha aside from the MC OP'ness. Most battle scenes are so well drawn and portrayed they make me feel like im watcing an anime Enjoyment(10/10) Despite the way I was shitting on this manwha before I still really enjoyed it and found it easy to not think about most of these problems before I finished this first season, so thats why im giving it a 7/10 overall its kinda like a \"turn your brain off\" thing."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Different Readers, Different Demands, if you seek a story that's well crafted, deep, brilliant character development, this is possibly not the manhwa for you, but think of it this way, there are generally 2 types of films, there are popcorn flicks, movies that boast an incredible budget and produce extraordinary spectacles, think of the MCU, Mission Impossible, John Wick, and then we have movies that don't necessarily have extraordinary special effects, maybe not a high budget, but is highly praised for its story, for its character development, perhaps The Godfather, perhaps Psycho, you get the idea, now, Solo Leveling is a manhwa equivalent of a ... popcorn flick, the manhwa does not have a deep intricate story or brilliantly paced character development, but if there's one thing it gets right, is that it's the ultimate fanservice, the art is glorious, and the author knows how to hype, as a reader of many isekai manga and also lots of crappy cultivation manhua, the capabilities of Sung Jin Woo is revealed to the reader in a way that makes us go \"damn, what a badass\" and not come off as cringe, and I can't forget the art, the art is absolutely glorious, the wide panels especially, ah god, amazing, so basically, if you just want a good time, turn your brain off and read some power fantasy comics from the holy trinity (Japan's Isekai, China's Cultivation, Korea's Monster Hunter) Solo Leveling is an absolute must-read, but if you're expecting an amazing story that rivals that of tower of god or something 20th Century Boys or something, it just ain't for you"}, {"score": "6", "content": "Okay, I don’t exactly know where to start, but I’ll try to do this as orderly as possible. To start with the less significant thing, the art style is actually pretty good, but most manhwa do end up looking all relatively the same to me. There’s no initial complaint about this honestly, though I do believe it’d look better as a gorey/action if it was done like a traditional manga (black and white, the typical ordeal). I’m usually picky with art style, so to me this is a somewhat important point to my typical critiques, but it won’t play a role here. Now, the plot is... ... mid at most, if I’m being completely honest. It’s very typical, extremely weak mc suddenly becomes extremely op. There’s a lot of components within this manhwa that I do dislike to some degree; stereotypical shounen, isekai, and underlying harem tones (though they aren’t that strong, I won’t give it too much complaint). But, this manhwa does have points I do like to contrast those (for the most part); an mc that isn’t excruciatingly annoying, monsters not constantly characterized by boobies and falling in love with the mc, and whenever harem tones are presented here, they’re almost immediately eliminated. Though, parts of me does wish Jinwoo was somewhat more like a villain rather than a constant one-man heroine, I do appreciate his character a lot more than I thought I did. The fact that he struggles more with humane conflicts rather than simply just strength is honestly a bit refreshing, too. But, even with all the good attributes of our mc, I ultimately feel like we’re getting nowhere in the story. It’s not at all enjoyable in the sense of “omg! I wonder what’s going to happen next,” it’s more of a “what the fuck didn’t we just solve the major conflict and there’s fucking more?” That entire part of it just made it stressful and somewhat obnoxious. And I don’t mean major conflict as in just fighting, I'm talking about genuine things surrounding mc that eventually get dealt with, and then it just drags out for a long while. That being said, it does leave a little bit of space for a somewhat unpredictable ending (though, I feel like it’ll take a Demon Slayer turn, just one massive L). Personally, I think saying this manhwa is amazing is an overstatement, but it isn’t straight up awful either. Though, I strongly believe that if this project is handed to the right company, the anime adaption would be pretty spectacular (it’s an action based series, it’s really more about the visual than the plot if we’re being completely honest). Maybe I’ll change my mind about it within time, because I’m too far in to drop it now. As it stands right now though, I’m settling on a 6/10 (edging closer to a 5.5, but there’s no rank for .5s, I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt)."}, {"score": "6", "content": "If you liked one punch man s1 and/or demon slayer, then there's a high chance that you'll like solo leveling.

It doesn't even bother to go serious with the story and characters. And turns out that has worked nicely for the comic. It builds up fights where it's pretty obvious that mc will win but the execution and art make it enjoyable. And after 153 chapters, it looks like the story will have some good developments ... soon.

I remember being confused after seeing the top lists since they were full of names I had never seen before. Over the years, I've kept these lists in my mind as a best-of when it comes to each medium, but after reading this holy shit have I been proven wrong (#14 overall and #1 manhwa at the time of writing this). I started going through Solo Leveling because its Korean origin intrigued me, but also because I saw it mentioned on a forum as an example of manga drawn ... in color. Art wise it hardly disappoints, it starts off great and it only get better as it goes on. The fight scenes in particular are impressive, they ended up being what kept me reading for the most part even though they are incredibly predictable due to story reasons. All other aspects aren't as grand however, which diminished my overall enjoyment. The story drops the ball almost instantly by making the protagonist the only character who is able to become stronger through a system of quests that he gains access to after a near-death experience in a dungeon (the \"why\" hasn't been explained yet). There just isn't much that can happen after this, obviously he's going to grind it out, it also doesn't help that these quests give him insane rewards. You can safely throw out all the usual buzzwords at this webtoon and they would all fit: wish fulfillment, derivative, power fantasy etc. It's somewhat salvaged in some of the later chapters, but I just can't get over how boring the story is for most of its length. The characters aren't much better either. The only one who is relevant for an extended period of time is the MC, everyone else is quickly forgotten after they've served their purpose. The MC himself, is kind of... shallow, I guess? You only have to read chapter 0 to realize that there's nothing super interesting about him. There is an attempt made at giving him a good motive for doing what he does, his mother's condition, but that isn't mentioned much apart from the beginning and late chapters of the webtoon. I probably would have enjoyed Solo Leveling quite a bit more in my early teens when I was still addicted to Metin 2 and loved to self-insert, but as it stands I can't give this that high of a score, and I definitely don't agree with the many people claiming this webtoon to be a masterpiece or to have a really unique story.

Although having such a fresh premise which is filled with potential for an amazing fantasy series, didn't really help this series. The story is very bland, and honestly has some pacing issues. The series just jumps from fighting against a C rank monsters to fighting against 3 S rank monsters in just few chapters. It scales ridiculously fast making the rankings ... have absolutely no weight to them which subsequently makes the series boring to read and makes the pacing feel rushed. The story is extremely predictable and repetitive. Sure it might have the cool charm to it but personally that really doesn't have any effect on the story. There are absolutely no stakes and you know no one's going to die as Sung Jin-woo will just come to save the day last second because it apparently makes him look cool. I'd also have to say that the conclusion was rushed and disappointing and left a lot of things loose. Characters: This is the weakest part of the series. As a series, it's only appeal is Sung Jin-woo being cool and the good art. Talking about Sung Jin-woo's character, he's very boring and honestly the manhwa's first arc was a lot more enjoyable than anything that came later onwards because it had an air of unpredictability and Sung Jin-woo was not just some overpowered character with the personality of a paper, but that's only the first arc. Jin-woo's character becomes very boring later and he just does anything that might be relatively cool in the given context, which obviously makes it feel like he has no personality. The other characters are unfortunately not any better. They first act cocky but then from there on, they are only there to do your typical anime's exaggerated remarks, \"NANI! NANDA! MASAKA\", whenever Jin-woo does something. The female characters are the same but they do one extra thing which is to blush a lot around Jin-woo and fall in love with him, this way the story creates forced romance between the characters. Art: Art is definitely the best aspect of this series. The art is great and really enhances the experience of the fight scenes. It's also aesthetically very pleasing and looks very cool. Enjoyment: It's honestly not that enjoyable. There are some cool moments but like I mentioned the predictability and the boring characters really make it hard to enjoy. If you're just looking for good action then you may enjoy this series but I think when everything is so poorly done even the brilliantly drawn action feels boring. Overall: 4/10 While some may say I'm being a bit harsh but I think that's a fair score for this series. It pretty much brings nothing new to the table and on top of that the conclusion was also unsatisfactory.

Why in the world does this thing here get so much praise and high ratings even though its pretty much just Sword Art Online in green. I mean the main character is even more edgy and even more of a Gary Stu than Kirito (and yes, I am a 100% sure the protagonist is indeed a self-insert of the autor, it just gets too comical at some point for this not to be the case). I would even dare to say that when it comes to the quality of the writing and overall plot SAO is the clearly better ... heap of dung (some flowers grow out of it at least). Solo Leveling certainly looks pretty nice but dig just a little deeper under that surface and all you will find is utter blandness and mediocrity.

How am I supposed to feel anything when there are no stakes and consequences and we pretty much start at 0 after every new battle? I would certainly think that Solo Leveling is the best thing that ever existed on this earth if I would still be between 10 and 16 years old. Sadly I am an adult now and developed that horrible thing called “critical thinking”. Flashy shit, cool monsters and edgy protagonists alone just don’t cut it for me anymore. And there really is nothing beyond that to find here. World building is pretty much non-existent and when we branch out we get a poor-mans Chimare Ant-arc scenario and side characters are utterly useless and forgettable. Seriously, are they only there to be impressed by the protagonist (especially the females)? Bottom line: Its utterly baffling to me how such a work gained so much popularity even though it does not bring anything new to the table.

These is well compensated enough by the great art and reasonably fast pacing to make up for this. When I think of power fantasy anime/manga/manhwa the first thing that comes to mind is one punch man. A world where the protagonist hopelessly outclasses everyone else but still has a solid, unique character to him along with a world brimming with interesting characters who all have their own struggles and goals. Now comparing that to solo leveling. Well 'solo' leveling is really what you get because ... while this story has a slew of interesting looking side characters, almost none of them get the screen time to be given any character after the first 30 ish chapters. So then what about the main character? Jin-woo is probably the most bland character you could ever write. He reacts like a piece of card board to everything. It really is a shame cause when you first are introduced to him, you get a sense of relatability and hope for this underdog family man, who even though he is 'the world's weakest hunter' still goes out every day to try to provide for his school age sister and comatose mother. But as soon as he gets power, all of that goes away. At times it becomes hard to even remember that his original goal was to help his mother and sister as they are thrown to the side as if they don't exist for some 80 chapters while MC just goes off and beats up monster after monster, with little to any thoughts in his head about well anything aside from killing more monster. This is especially exemplified when at one point somewhat early on, Jin-woo's sister asks to join him on a jog as she notices he's been working out. So what does Jin-woo do? Totally abandons his sister and sprints as fast as he can with no care for where she is or care for connecting with her as she is trying to do with him right now. Scenes like these are so frustrating because as a reader I WANT to feel a connection with these side characters, but all Jin-woo cares about is getting more power at the expense of any connection to those around him. At the end of the day this is a really fun read but it woefully lacks the charming characters of something like one punch man or even Reincarnated as a Slime, that really makes the story feel whole. It especially is sad because there are some fun characters in here that I yearned to know more about, but just as quickly as they show up so quickly are they gone.

The top rated manhwa on MAL (at least at time of writing). It's seemingly everywhere, especially since Season 2 has started. It's been a while since the start to Season 2, and I feel like I should put my two cents out for this manhwa. Solo Leveling is a fun series to read. It's a guilty pleasure, a wish fulfillment manhwa. It has a very simple story, with flat characters. That isn't a bad thing. Solo Leveling is a power fantasy, you can't really rate it with something like Vinland Saga. Many people criticize it ... for it's often repetitive plotline, and very bland characters. Even though I do agree for the most part, you can't argue that the series really did do the concept of \"power fantasy\" correctly. Power fantasy is the new battle shonen. A recurring genre in the manga/manhwa industry nowadays. All power fantasies have a very overpowered main character who can practically destroy all the other characters. It's a relatively simple genre to write in, and quite profitable, which is why it's been extremely popular the past few years. Great examples of this are \"That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime\" or in a sense \"Sword Art Online\", who probably started this whole trend in the first place. Solo Leveling did this right. It made the story just interesting enough so that it would feel unique, and it's art only further boosts it's worth. Many people are criticizing Solo Leveling because of it's characters. And yes, I do agree that most of the characters are very bland. The character designs are really cool, but they do feel repetitive. The faces look really similar to be honest, but this isn't really a criticism, since a lot of manga have the same problem. The problem behind the characters is how they are used. All of them are just conveniently used just to add to the plot, only to disappear, never to be seen again. Of course, a lot of manhwa do this, but it's especially annoying when you find an actual interesting character, but they just get thrown aside. The protagonist is also a big problem. Sung Jin-Woo is just a really inconsistent character. Most of time, he's a very edgy character who doesn't care about anyone except himself and his family. However he can also seem like a light-hearted and often clueless character. It just doesn't match up. His character just feels very bland, and there isn't a unique trait anywhere. The only time I liked him as a character was in the first few chapters. In the first few chapters, Sung Jun-Woo was genuinely likable. He was polite and determined, despite being the weakest hunter. The story would be a lot more interesting if it was an underdog to hero story, like My Hero Academia or Naruto. Instead, the author trashes his character almost instantly, and he becomes an edge lord for no particular reason. At least Sasuke had an actual reason for being edgy. Sung Jin-Woo just became an edge lord with no reason at all. If he had kept his original personality, I would've liked him a lot more. I feel really sorry for the other characters, as in the manhwa, they explicitly state that the other characters have no room for growth, except for our protagonist. Think of Krillin from Dragon Ball. Does he have nearly as much screen time as Goku in the later parts of the story? Does he really do anything that important? The same exact thing happens in Solo Leveling. Other characters just become irrelevant, chained down by the story's own rules. The plot is mediocre. It's trying to be mysterious and complicated when it really isn't. The author continues to try and throw mysteries in your face, but those don't really grab my attention. Basically, it's trying to hard to have an interesting plot. Power fantasies restrict themselves from being too complicated. The stories are designed for people to turn their minds off for a while, and just enjoy the simple story. Solo Leveling tries to be unique in that aspect by introducing a mystery into the plot. Instead of being an attention grabber, it just becomes a minor annoyance to readers. Power fantasies shouldn't have overarching mysteries like other manga. That's just not the appeal of it. I'll stop criticizing it for now. The art is fantastic. It's clean and unique, with really awesome moments. I'd say the art itself carries 50% of the entire series. It makes it quite interesting to read, and it sets the series apart from others of the same genre (power fantasy), which usually only have mediocre art. Most of my enjoyment of the series is just admiring the beautiful artwork. The fight scenes are also quite unique, usually composed of glowing eyes and lines that flash around the panels. Other than that, I can't really say much. Overall, Solo Leveling is a good series. It does what it wants well. Yet I think the rating of the series is a lot higher than it should be. Solo Leveling is not a masterpiece. It's no where near one. The main character is overly edgy, and the other characters are thrown to the side after the author has used them. You can see that this series is specifically targeting those who enjoy these power fantasies, not people who enjoy thought-provoking series. It tries too hard to appeal to both sides, which leaves the plot into a jumbled mess. It isn't a bad series. It's actually good, for a power fantasy that is. The series is still a while from over, so I guess I'll keep reading on for now..."}, {"score": "8", "content": "*spoilers ahead* okay..by far I've really enjoyed the story. The art style is brilliant and I've got some nice wallpapers XD it's overall a fun read, although I have a few complaints about it. # The mc is too op. He literally NEVER fails and NEVER makes any mistakes. He does massive quests with zero consequences. HE went from 0 to 100 real quick but having barely any difficulties is bullshit. He literally had NO single moment where he had to choose between two grave choices and somehow had to regret it. # It's not only the mc, but everyone who develops/might develop (in the future) a close ... relation with mc NEVER dies because of the plot armour. I can't remember a single person who was close to the mc faced any grave consequence. # I know he is always leveling up and supposed to be the best hunter in the world, but he ALWAYS winning seems annoying. Literally not a single hunter stands a chance against him even when they were supposed to be as strong as him. # The fight with the architect..like man seriously? How did he even win against those, considering he didn't even have his shadow soldiers there with him. He's always getting special rewards and level-ups exactly the moment he needs it..seems too convenient. you just always exactly know what the outcome will be and that makes the fights boring. last but not the least, I'm excited for the forthcoming fight. also the mystery of his father and the history of rulers and monarchs are yet to be unfold. I also wanna see where the story goes next. happy reading!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Solo Leveling is a super enjoyable read, one of the best manhwa i've read. If you're a fan of OP MC stomping people this series is definitely for you, but that isn't all, something about this series is quite different and it always brings you the hype for each chapter. Story 8/10 At first you might be skeptical about it, expecially if you followed shounen genre or series like One Punch Man and Overlord. The story is nothing revolutionary, but overall it's still very solid and enjoyable... this is your classic \"from zero to hero\" but with the skillset very similar to the \"player\" in RPG game, ... if you followed another manhwa \"The Gamer\" you'll feel extremely familiar with this series. Art 10/10 One of the best aspect of this series, the art is so beautiful and looks very cool, everything (the fights, the expression, the characters) are so well drawn.... props to the artist for this. Character 7/10 Honestly i don't find most characters are super appealing aside from the MC, some characters might feel reasonable and relatable but surprisingly i didn't find anyone outshine or in the same place as the MC. I only read the manhwa so far this might change later on, but overall it's an ok from me. Enjoyment 9/10 Every chapter is hype, the author did a good job to cut the parts where you feel \"wow, so cool\" or you can't wait for the next one. Some of readers might unable to see the hype as i agree that the story is quite cliche, but hey even Kimetsu No Yaiba and BNHA are very cliche but people are still enjoying it, this manhwa gives the same vibe. Overall 9/10 I can understand the hype around this series, this series delivers well... it isn't your harem art online or incest OP series, overall it's a good read, you should also tried it, definitely have a chance to compete with another Japanese shounen mangas."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Story: The story is quite good, though I see a lot of different reviews saying \"this isn't your typical OP protagonist\". Well actually, it is. I mean, it's okay because the story itself is good and I like the world the author created, but shit, the protagonist doesn't take a loss lol. Sure he's up against some strong guys, but he doesn't really come close to losing. Which I think is poor storytelling as this is getting quite repetitive now. Art: I mean, it's colored and the amount of detail in everything is astounding. Fantastic art style and it's well maintained throughout the series (the quality ... doesn't diminish the later you get into the story). Character: The characters are good, a bit 2 dimensional, there's one point where I thought a demon would become sort of a love interest/side kick, but it never ended up being a thing which is kind of lame because the story needed some extra spicing up. Overall, this is a very good story. The art and pacing makes it an enjoyable read and I scored it accordingly. I know the story is a bit repetitive or dull, but the pacing and overall grand-story (ants), allows for a positive experience."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Almost at the season 1 finish line (currently at ch. 104) and the only thing I dislike about this manhwa is this: considering the main character is, well, overpowered, most villains lacked the development needed to make them feel scary. At no point did I feel like the main character was in real danger and although it was super satisfying to see him absolutely destroy all in his path, and smirk with arrogance, it was always the expected outcome. Leaving that aside, if at any point you played world of warcraft or dark souls and liked it, then this manhwa is for you."}, {"score": "9", "content": "A webtoon that is destined to get an anime adaptation. When reading the first few chapters I did get annoyed by how cliché their whole plot was at first glance; the whole weak MC becomes strong trope. It gave off the impression that Solo levelling had a pretty shallow plot which is nothing but far from the truth. However for some reason I didn't mind following such an over saturated story concept. One could say even though it was a overpopulated theme basically being regurgitated to us, other aspects of the manga is what really captivated me and kept me reading up until the end. ... One would be the character development. Sung in my eyes is truly one finely crafted character. Even though no direct characterisation is showcased, through his actions and dialogue alone, I as the reader could tell what type of a person sung truly is. Think of it as, \"he was so well developed that if the mange ever left me on a cliff hanger I already knew what sung was about to do next.\" No, I'm not saying he is a boring predicable MC but rather he is one MC that appears to be more \"human\" in terms of a fictional character. Two would be the production quality itself. Webtoons in my opinion are more enjoyable to look at than your traditional Japanese manga. I don't know the colour difference really does it for me tbh and solo levelling does not disappoint with well drawn fights which are detailed to the bone I would say as far as \"artworks\" are concerned Solo levelling out plays its fellow webtoon buddies such as Tower of God. Lastly, it would be the rush atmosphere conveyed by Solo levelling. From chapter one up until the very last chapter I always felt a sense of urgency while reading solo levelling. The pacing of different arcs was done in such fast way that I never got bored and was always on edge to find out what would happen next and in my eyes that is something all action \"Shonen\" type webtoons/mangas should aim for. Conclusion Its a good read and i would definitely recommend it to action junkies who cant get enough of well drawn fights and an interesting plot which has some depth to it."}, {"score": "9", "content": "So yeah the Story is as generic as it can get the characters are not that complex and very monotonus but is it a waste of time?

Do we always need complex characters with unique plot and genius story telling? Yes sometimes BUT SOMETIMES WE JUST NEED TO SIT BACK AND ENJOY WHATEVER IS HAPPENING AND CHEER ON THE BADASSERY WE WITNESS.

It doesn't do anything groundbreaking, it's mostly just an exciting, action-oriented series. The character's aren't very complex, the 'good' characters and the 'bad' characters are split very distinctly, although it could be argued that some fall into a more morally-grey area. That being said, this series is just fun to read. Don't look too hard into it, cause you'll definitely see cracks, just sit back and enjoy the art. This area of the review is more spoiler-y, as it critiques the writing of the characters and the plot, so be warned. As someone who has completed the light novel, I can ... confidently say that Jin-Woo is a flat, boring character. At first, he was a bit more dynamic, struggling to accept the idea of killing for his own benefit. It's exciting, watching him barely escape the hidden double dungeon, and seeing the other characters survive, leaving him for death. In my opinion, it's the best part of the series, as it feels the most realistic, and the art really helps to elevate it. However, as the story carries on, Jin-Woo becomes unstoppable. At first, it's exciting, as we saw the journey he went on, and celebrate his dominance after years of being a complete underdog, but it starts to become stale. Take the Ant-Arc for example, it felt like the Chimera Ant Arc, just worse. We know that Jin-Woo is just going to teleport over there, after reconciling with his Mom, so it is very difficult to fear the Ants spreading to other places on Earth. Then, we are just proven right, as Jin-Woo sweeps in and saves everyone, easily defeating the big, bad bug that we saw destroy everyone else. This story loses all tension after this point. This part of the review goes into spoilers for the light novel, so beware manhwa readers. After this, we are introduced to the Monarchs, and they're intriguing, and they pull through, managing to genuinely injure Jin-Woo after seeing him destroy everything for the majority of the story. But, then, he gets the Shadow Monarch's power and obliterates the other Monarchs, and honestly, I was bored. Maybe because I didn't have the art, because it certainly helps this series, but it just solidified the notion that Jin-Woo will never need anyone else, because he can do it all himself. I would've loved something different to happen, like the other hunters doing something for once, rather than them just begging for Jin-Woo every two seconds. I know the Monarchs were set up to be these big bads that no hunter could stand up to, but I hated that concept entirely. It just made it feel like the Hunters were there for no reason, and it got boring seeing the same fighting style over and over again. Shadows are only cool for so long. Plus, the scenes outside of action were outrageously boring. Jin-Woo is an incrediblely stale character, and has no unique character traits or relationships that allow him to support a scene solely involving himself. Again, at the beginning, this was not issue, but eventually, he became a Mary Sue."}, {"score": "9", "content": "It is my first manga.

For me, it was a hit. The narrative does not try to break the boundaries of already established formulas and plays it rather safe. And it does a great job at that. Never did it hit a level of mediocrity, it was always fun and enjoyable. Overall it is an easy read with a good flow. The story never gets too weird or derails at any point. From start to finish it has one concept in mind and follows that one idea until it ends, that idea being our ... main character getting more and more overpowered. A decent amount of arcs get introduced, with all of them being handled with care and adding to the overall picture. The story might be a bit slow for certain tastes at first but picks up speed quickly. I never got bored reading through the chapters and always felt entertained. Characters A strong cast of characters fill the manhwa. They won't shock you or surprise you, but they are solid throughout and perfect for the story the author is telling. We get a good mixture of different traits and motivations, some being more developed than others, but all of them fulfill their given roles. The main character follows the simple rule of being a total badass all of the time, which might be a bit too much for some, but he also shows a soft and caring side from time to time. Sung Jin-Woo does get a harem, sort of, but thankfully they didn't go overboard with it. Art It's stunning. Seriously, the art style is amazing. Beautiful colors and lots of details everywhere, yet still easy to follow and crisp. You can tell that a lot of passion and love went into the art. Overall Opinion A great manhwa from start to finish. Even better if you are a fan of fantasy and have a soft spot for overpowered characters. Just for the art alone, it's worth giving it a try and as long as you don't expect some never-before-seen mind-blowing story development, you will have a fun time."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Solo Leveling, on first glance is the korean version of Isekai Mangas and Light Novel. Select few charaters go to a different world to battle monster that no other human beings can fight. Among them is our MC who was weak but suddenly became OP and he has one best girl with harem of girls having feelings for him. However, if you start reading the manhwa, you'll realize that this is not just Korean version of Isekai Genre. It's much more. Solo Leveling (Originally titled \"Only I Level Up\" in the webnovel) is a manhwa (Korean Manga) which tells the story of Sung Jin-Woo (one of ... the few characters in this manhwa that I'll probably remember because pronouncing Korean names are a bit tough compared to Chinese and Japanese), an E-ranked hunter living in a world where select few people known as the hunters go to a different world through a portal known as \"The Gate\" to battle and defeat monsters before they make their way into their own world. The hunters of SL have a fixed ranking that does not go up or down no matter how hard they try or laze around and their ranking range from E to S and to National Level (read the manhwa to find out the difference). The protagonist Sung Jin-Woo is an E-ranked hunter but is the most weakest among the weakest rank that he is known as \"The World's Weakest\" and his existence is considered so mocking that the other hunters made a rumor that if he joins a Hunters raid, it's an easy win for them. However things go south as the hunters Jin-Woo is accompanying in a raid runs into a Dungeon within a Dungeon (i.e. Hidden Dungeon) and begins to get slaughtered leaving Sung Jin-Woo as the sole survivor. But it was not in vain as because of that, he received an exclusive ability to increase his rank with certain conditions. Meaning he is the only one among the hunters that could level up. Thus, the title is called Solo Leveling. Solo Leveling is not just your typical Isekai Power Fantasy where the MC is OP because he is the MC. Here we get to see the MC struggling, training and working hard into becoming powerful and slowly but surely as he goes from being dubbed \"The World's Weakest\" to being a World Level Hero. It's basically One Punch Man if we got to see Saitama's Journey into becoming the One Punch Man. There are times we see him describe an opponent more powerful than him only to train and see the opponent's reaction as he surpassed him on every level. The reason we enjoy and love Solo Leveling is because we get to see the character grow powerful and break his own boundary while those around him stay in the same power level. It may seem unfair but that's nothing compared to how weak the MC was when the story started. It is a piece of art that has a cast of colorful characters including Joo Jin-Ho, Sung Jin-Ah, Cha Hae-In and Go Gung-Hee (if you wanna know what makes them special, read the manhwa) mixed with amazing and Mind F#$king fight scenes that if it was animated by the likes of Ufotable or MAPPA, it would break many records. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have it's flaws. Solo Leveling takes its time to show the characters journey to Omnipotence as it is broken down into small pieces showing the MC's difference of strength in each arcs. And we do see the character struggle to his journey to being the strongest but we don't see him fall. Not even once. The manhwa takes elements from Shonen Genre along with Isekai, and what makes Shonen genre likable is the point that we get to see our MC fall down only to rise up stronger, but we don't see that from Jin-Woo. We only him assess a potential opponent on first meeting or just by the mere mention of their name only to have a showdown with them at their first and final confrontation. Not once do we see the MC lose a fight which would make the story more interesting as we would see him come back stronger than before and take him/her down. Which brings me to its second flaw, the fights. The fights are amazingly drawn and animated that it may make you want toeither be a part of it or be glad that you aren't a part of it. However, almost all fights in this manhwa is centred around Jin-Woo with predetermined outcomes (i.e. he wins) and the fights that are centered around characters other than Jin-Woo seems less impactful and only serves to show the power difference between the characters themselves and Jin-Woo. There were exceptions however, such as the fight between Jin-Woo and Thomas Andre and the fight between Jin-Woo and three Monarchs of Sovereign which despite it's predetermined outcomes were still enjoyable. Yet despite all that, the fights make the story look like it was \"Solo Played\" by Jin-Woo (pun intended). The third flaw I came across is character development. As mentioned before, Solo Leveling takes elements from both Isekai and Shonen Genre, and one of the greatest things about Shonen genre is the character development not just for the MC but also for the side characters, antagonists and minor characters as well. However there are a few characters that the show build up only to forget about, such as The Demon Princess Eris and and Jin-Ah's BFF Han Song-I along with many others. Then there are the rest of the side and supporting characters (not antagonists) who are introduced as the most strongest only to become weaker as the story progresses. Notable example is Cha Hae-In, who was introduced in the first volume as the S-rank Hunter who in Jin-Woo's opinion is stronger than the S-rank Hunter dubbed as \"The Ultimate Soldier\" only to continue as a Hajidere (like Hinata Hyuga from Naruto) in front of Sung Jin-Woo which is a major downgrade if you ask me. And I get it, it's not easy to develop characters other than the MC who is OP because the story is either told from their perspective or is centered around them, and fleshing out characters other than MC means to give the characters the spotlight for a few moments which can be good or bad and a gamble that many writers often skips out on. Regardless, if you overlook the flaws of the manhwa, you get an enjoyable reading experience. When I was going through the stories, I thought the ending would be similar to that of Demon Slayer where the Demon Slayer Corps was disbanded after the death of Muzan. Similarly, Sung Jin-Woo might end the gates for good thus ending the reason for Hunters and Hunters Association to exist. And I did got something a bit similar. I won't say what the ending was but I'll say this, it's kind of sad that nobody would know or understand what he had to go though to let them live in such peaceful world. I also thought that it would end in Sung Jin-Woo's passing, which (thankfully) didn't occur. After reading the ending I found out there is an additional side story in the webnovel it is based on which tells the story from the perspective of the child of Sung Jin-Woo (now married with kids) as he discovers his father's omnipotent power. Sadly it was not adapted into the webcomic, but many fans are requesting it and I hope I get to see it myself. Despite its flaws, Solo Leveling is an enjoyable and a binge worthy read for any and every Isekai Power Fantasy lovers such as myself. With great story, world building, colorful characters, fight scenes and art style that nearly comes close to The Last Supper by Leonardo Da Vinci or Sistine Chapel Ceiling by Michelangelo if not for it being digital, Solo Leveling is a piece of art that every manga and manhwa readers should try and it is also a gateway for future manhwa readers who have yet to read a manhwa."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I have reread this manga twice and each time I read it I am filled with tremendous awe for such creation.

Its brilliance is multifaceted, making it a standout in the realm of manhwa. While initially elusive, the essence of Solo Leveling's greatness becomes clear upon deeper reflection.

Sung Jin-Woo, while not entirely original, resonates with readers, drawing parallels to iconic characters like Kirito. Their transformative journeys, from weakness to becoming the saviors of their respective worlds, are captivating. Even the similarities between their sisters, both in appearance and unwavering loyalty, add depth to the narrative. This brief ... overview merely scratches the surface of Solo Leveling's ingenuity. Beyond its surface, Solo Leveling's allure is undeniable. Its brilliance lies not only in its captivating artwork but also in its faithful adaptation of the source material. Unlike many adaptations, Solo Leveling remains true to its origins, enriching the experience for fans. As the story unfolds, readers are ensnared, unable to resist the allure of each chapter. It's no surprise that it ranks among the top manhwa, captivating both seasoned fans and newcomers alike. After much contemplation, the answer to its allure becomes evident. Solo Leveling earns a well-deserved 9/10. While not without flaws, its gripping narrative and stunning visuals make it a standout in the genre. The only aspect preventing it from achieving a perfect score is its slight lack of uniqueness. While exceptional, Solo Leveling occasionally treads familiar ground, preventing it from reaching the pinnacle of originality.

These reviews are dumb as fuck, and they don't contribute anything. The review doesn't look at the Manhwa from a story standpoint and how well-developed characters are. When they see Sung-JinWoo pull something badass of they, say \"oops, 10/10, will read again\". Ok rant over The story isn't extraordinary—usual Weak to Strong tale that you can find everywhere. Sung-Jinwoo, A weak person, goes through a near-death experience and is ... handed cheat powers. Take those words into account and apply those words to all the other manga, Manhua, and Manhwas that apply that concept. Quite a lot, right? Correct, this story concept isn't original, BUT it all depends on the execution of that concept. I must say that the execution is decent at best. Wen he gains those cheat powers he starts training because his cheat told him to. Then, he goes up 2 ranks, and he hasn't got out of the hospital yet. After that, he clears does one dungeon and he's already on par with a B-Rank hunter (If you read solo leveling you know that B to A rank hunters are nothing compared to Sung Jin-Woo, but these guys are supposed to be the Main High ranking hunters of hunter guilds, and he just became one in like, what, a month, maybe less?). He further gets cheat abilities via Job mission, defeats a Red gate boss, then when he clears a couple of floors in the Demon Dungeon, he's already barely an S rank by chapter 57. This story is just Sung-Jinwoo kicking ass but just as discreet as possible. Do I like it? Fuck yeah I love it, but that's only because I want to see Sung Jin-Woo further become stronger and see what he does in the future. Other than that, realistically this story has barely any character development. Art is a 10/10, Art is consistent, really detailed, and the story has a lot of badass moments that make you want more. That's it, nothing more, nothing less.

The art is vibrant enough for a thoughtless read through, but there are no takeaways or overarching themes that make me think.

The actions and pacing are good enough to binge in a few hours."}, {"score": "5", "content": "A while ago, an anime YouTuber I highly respected said that “Solo Leveling is the best story to ever come out”. More recently, a good friend of mine who knows his anime & manga told me that “solo leveling was the best self-insert fantasy I’ve read”. Lastly a not-so-bright person on some online forums wrote that he thought that “solo leveling was better Dostoevsky”. Well I’m sorry to spoil the party, but after having recently completed reading Solo Leveling I think those above sentiments are misguided and wrong. Very wrong. Sure, Solo Leveling is by far the most successful Korean webtoon to come out, but ... (in my humble opinion) it is storywise incredibly generic and unoriginal, and I see little reason (aside from the artwork) that it deserves the praise and attention it’s been receiving. Let me explain: Starting with the plot, Solo Leveling takes place in the not-too-distant future where gates have appeared across the world that have magical beasts, monsters, and items inside of them. Humans with innate magical abilities, called “hunters” get together in guilds and adventure into the gates where they slay beasts and collect magical items to sell. As mentioned above, Hunters have inherent abilities, and are ranked from the lowest (E) to the highest (S). The main character Sung Jin-Woo starts off as an E-ranked as is nicknamed the “World’s weakest hunter”, but because of plot developments he gains the ability to level up, gradually becoming stronger and stronger, to the point in the latter chapters where he is completely invincible. While that sounds cool, anyone who is even remotely acquainted with anime and/or manga will also realize how generic and overdone this storyline is. Solo Leveling’s storyline is nearly a straight copy of other well-known power fantasies such as “Sword Art Online” and “Danmachi”. Jin-Woo himself is nearly indistinguishable from Tatsuya from “The Irregular at Magic High School” franchise in that they are illogically overpowered, have the same boring expressionless deadpan face, and that they mostly care only about being powerful and protecting their family (especially their sister). And just like in the aforementioned franchises, Solo Leveling is also like them in that there is a steady stream of incompetent guys and large-breasted girls that the protagonist has to rescue. Most hilariously however is the Jeju Island arc, coming about half way in Solo Leveling, which I shit you not, is utterly, completely, plagiarized from the Chimera ants arc in “Hunter x Hunter”. I mean literally, you have an isolated island full of rapidly evolving giant ants that like to eat humans, with one of them being specifically bred to be the strongest ant of all time, with a team of the world’s strongest hunters being sent out to stop them. The writing and world-building in Solo Leveling is largely a mixed bag. While there are some nice moments of foreshadowing and a few interesting twists, by and large Solo Leveling is rather predictable, especially in the latter chapters as the protagonist Jin-Woo becomes so overpowered that there is hardly any suspense or tension as you the reader know that he will win anyways. While it was nice to see how the whole concept and economics of hunters and their guilds is expanded not just to Korea but other counties as well, the world building in Solo Leveling is rather weak. There are some notable plot holes, for example why does the world in Solo Leveling resemble the 21st-century world in so many ways, such as for example having hospitals and high schools, when there are humans that through no effort of their own have magical healing powers and can fix fatal wounds with a mere spell. Wouldn’t you think that the healer Hunters would be hired to work at said hospitals instead of aimlessly wandering around gates in search of magical items? The characters in Solo Leveling are a mixed bag, but as mentioned above are mostly generic. Sung Jin-Woo is very much your typical self-insert protagonist in your power fantasy. The males in Solo Leveling are all arrogant and generally incompetent, the women all have unrealistically large busts. Overall the Chairman was my favorite character. The character designs were also inconsistent, the Japanese Hunters that appear right before the Jeju Island are had some cool designs but some of the others were illogical and generic. There was this one time in the story that Jin-Woo joins this group to raid a gate and I almost burst out laughing, as the Hunters from this guild all looked like they came out of the most generic possible fantasy anime cosplay party. Something annoying the writer keep doing in the story is that they keep introducing new female characters that I guess are supposed to be romantically attracted to Jin-Woo, only for them to disappear after a couple chapters and never to be brought up again. To put it blulntly, aside from Cha Hae-In all the female characters in Solo Leveling are irrelevant. At the very least Solo Leveling does not de-evolve into a harem as most other power fantasies do. Obviously the most positive aspect of Solo Leveling is the art. It starts off okay, but it gets steadily better after the first 30 chapters. The fight scenes were the best drawn, especially latter in the series, and the panel lay out was competently done. My favorite scenes artistically wise had to be Jin-Woo’s battles with the orcs, with the more varied complex character designs and color pallets. While Solo Leveling does have a few positive aspects, overall it is far, far too generic to recommend, and the popularity. Not that Manhwas are particularly known for their originality, but with so many aspects of Solo Leveling being identical to other stories, I see little reason why it has achieved such outstanding popularity and critical acclaim. At the very least the popularity of Solo Leveling may have brought the world of Korean webtoons to a wider audience, but even then there are manhwas out there that I feel are better written and have better art than Solo Leveling, but that’s my opinion."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Solo Leveling... The #1 ranked manhwa.. Does absolutely nothing new or innovative. Let me explain. Solo Leveling follows Sung Jin-Woo in your typical power fantasy story of \"the world's weakest hero\" turning into the #1 hero in the world. There are no deep themes, and it doesn't try to do anything new. It is exactly as it sounds. Just another power fantasy story. But this story is by no means bad just because it doesn't try to do something different. Now, is it the 28th best manga of all time and the number one manhwa ever created? No. Absolutely not. And it's puzzling to me why this ... would get such high scores and not something like say, Sword Art Online when they're basically the same thing. And so I went on to looking to MAL reviews for answers... and came with absolutely nothing. The main points people in their reviews have made is basically that \"This isn't your typical power fantasy\" but then do nothing to reinforce their point. They just say \"This story is extremely good.\" and leave it at that. Now let me tell you that this manhwa is actually a good manhwa. Now it seems that I'm contradicting myself, right? Except not. I never said that this story is bad. It's the opposite actually. I compared it to SAO earlier but I gotta say that this is a lot better of a power fantasy story. This story does everything it tries to do extremely fucking well. The art is godlike, with full-colored panels to better understand and enjoy everything that happens. The hype moments of the previously weak guy destroying the top hunters are extremely well done and I really enjoyed it. If you enjoy power fantasy stories, then this is one of the best you can find. And this is why I changed my score from a 5 to a 6 after a second reading. At first I was annoyed that this manhwa was getting amazing ratings when it was nothing more than an average power fantasy story. But after a second reading I realized that this story doesn't try to be a thought-provoking masterpiece or anything. It just tries to be your average power fantasy story, and the execution is perfect. So it's not really that average. In terms of power fantasy stories at least. Oh yeah, don't try to argue that Sung Jin-Woo is a good character because at first he's the weak loser and then we see him rise and become the badass hero. I say that because I saw a lot of people just saying \"Characters (10/10): We see the character as a weakling and we follow him as he becomes strong...\". He's a perfect character just without the strength. He doesn't have any flaws. It's literally what everyone shits on SAO about and it's basically every isekai MC. It's not deep. Being weak isn't a character flaw. If a character's only flaw is being weak, it's not a good character. So yeah. Good art (10/10), a bit above average story just because the world has some original aspects (6/10), bad characters (4/10), high enjoyment cause of very well executed hype moments (9/10). Overall rating: 6/10. CONCLUSION: If you want a geniunely good and innovative story, search elsewhere. But if you want a power fantasy story, you're in the best place you could ever be. Side note: One thing I realized after seing this rare case of a typical power fantasy getting amazing ratings is that, generally, people don't search for stories with good writing. They mainly just want something they'll enjoy. And I think people started hating on SAO because a minority of reviewers were really loud about how bad the writing is and then, after listening to the points the reviewers made, the general anime community realized how bad SAO was and started shitting on it. But I think people actually enjoyed it. I know I did at least. But I also gave it a low score. Why? Because just because something is bad, doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. So when the anime of Solo Leveling releases, and the masses get a hold of it, I personally think it just might become the next SAO as in that everyone is gonna start hating on it. But who knows. This is just a wild guess."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Plot: 5/10. The plot doesn't even make sense towards the end. The only good thing is the premise established but it is ruined past chapter like 80 when the plot stops making sense and you realize the only thing keeping you hooked is the cool fights.

A strong character that is then surpassed by Sun Jin Woo to showcase how much he is growing (the moment they stop being strong they are dropped to never be seen again aka the S class hunters and many more) or 2.

The MC is repetitive. The only attribute he has is having a cool power and never losing a fight. Bland. Literally, he goes from being a nerd to a cool 6,3 dude who pulls hot chicks.

It hooks you."}, {"score": "5", "content": "This is gonna be a long one.. because I have a lot to say about this “Manhwa.” First off it’s important to establish something before we talk about anything. You’re either gonna really love this or really hate it, that’s because you’ll either see the problems it has and not care; or you’ll absolutely hate it right away because of those problems. This was hyped up A LOT, after reading review after review and seeing the ratings this got. I was basically allowed to assume that this is one of the best. But I just can’t really agree with the side of people that love ... this, which is fine; we all have different opinions. These problems I mentioned are unavoidable by the way, what I mean by that is that you’re gonna notice them eventually. As long as you think about it and have developed your brain, you will see the problems. Let’s go fishing. First and foremost this is the “MC becomes extremely OP and the strongest thing alive” kind of story. You figured it shouldn't be difficult to create a story around something like that. But you’d be surprised. Moving on, what I think is important with stories like these is the characters and MCs motives. If you nail those then you got something good with a story like this. But neither of those are there and that’s the biggest knife in the chest this Manhwa has. Let me talk about the story first. This story isn’t good, it mainly follows the same pattern and cycle a lot of the time after the first arc. 1. Jin-Woo enters a dungeon, 2. levels up, 3. finds stuff and asks questions, then leaves. After this an outside event happens which most of the time isn’t really interesting or intriguing enough to make you want to continue reading. Then after that some outside events happen. He goes back to another dungeon to repeat the same thing! This supposedly “story” follows this same cycle over and over with barely any character motives or actual story to go off of ever. When the actual outside events happen, guess what? They’re super uninteresting and I could care less about them. They are just character interactions that aren't really that good because they’re mostly just the same thing over and over again. Which is mostly praising Sung Jin-Woo, or wanting to hire him. It doesn’t end there however after the author becomes tired of the whole dungeon cycle, he then decides to move onto a new pattern. 1. World or People are in danger. 2. Only Sung Jin-Woo can stop the danger. 3. Comes in and Stops Danger. 4. World saved. After the whole dungeon cycle you’ll notice this is essentially the same cycle but to be fair it only gets repeated like two times, so not bad considering the almost 10 times the dungeon one got repeated right? After these it seems like the story is finally doing something, it’s finally building off something. What is that something!? It’s the system. It finally uses something that it made and uses it to develop a story. Finally after like 110 Chapters I’m intrigued and entertained hopefully they don’t botch this! They botched it. That is all. In my opinion it was botched because of the still somewhat poor characters and their interactions still, although not as bad as they have been; it was still bad nonetheless. It was also rushed, and didn’t feel right at all. Also you like never get an explanation for things they kind of just assume that the reader can figure it out? I think they wanted to try to make the reader interested in the topics or questions and leave them with little hints to figure that out. But it’s not really an interesting topic and is the least of my concerns when reading. Again that has to do with me not caring about the characters as well I think. Well finally after 150 something chapters you get that explanation with the final chapters. A explanation about what is actually going on with everything. An explanation long overdue about a topic or question that I really didn’t care about either. Because the question was brought up so late. So the reveal wasn’t really that nice either. Let me tell you about the characters, I don’t care about them at all. They’re not interesting, and why are they here? These characters just overall feel empty, there really isn’t a reason to like them; is the reason supposed to be because they’re cool? That’s such a poor excuse, sometimes they’ll throw in this random character that you will not remember the name of and kill them off. Was I supposed to feel some sort of shock or sadness when that happened? Frankly I didn’t, because I didn’t care about that guy plus I didn’t remember their name. I was once told, if you don’t remember the characters name then they’re most likely not important. That was like almost every single character here. Of course when they switch from supporting character to supporting character, there is little to no development that happens in these characters. Even when the main supporting characters get beat up, I still don’t feel bad or angry whatsoever. I’m mad that the author decided that they’re gonna do that and thought it would do something. Think about it carefully when reading, these side characters don’t change that much when they’re introduced. You don’t feel or see the change that should happen, they literally just exist and they feel like a background character that randomly just came in for a dialogue. I am telling you literally the truth: all of these characters follow only the same 4 paths and motives. 1. Kill or Fight Sung Jin-Woo. 2. Promote Sung Jin-Woo to Their Guild. 3. Geek out about Sung Jin-Woo or Praise Sung Jin-Woo. 4. Beg Sung Jin-Woo for help. That’s all they do continuously throughout the entire story. It's so damn annoying and boring to read, and it’s not even funny. I almost dropped this Manhwa because of these characters. I cannot think of a character that existed in this entire Manhwa that actually was there for something else besides Sung Jin-Woo. You figured that instead of focusing on Sung Jin-Woo all the time we would at least get to see what these other characters do, if they have any other motive that isn’t Sung Jin-Woo. Get this, that does happen we do focus sometimes on the life of others, but guess what? Those events still are focusing on Sung Jin-Woo somehow in some way. Please can they at least attempt to give these characters other motives that don’t involve Sung Jin-Woo, can they give them some backstory or background? They don’t even feel relatable. I don't know why they just don’t. I don’t even really like Sung Jin-Woo himself, which brings me to the next point. The MC himself and his motives are really poor and depressing as well. He has no motives at all, and when he finds a motive that the story can actually do something with, it gets rid of it within like 10 chapters and when that mission is complete the impact or accomplishment is just so.. not there. This guy's motto every single time he enters a dungeon is “I need to get stronger!” Which was really cool and touching the first 3 times..but got tired quickly when he could now easily kick everyone's ass after the first 3 dungeons. At first this guy was everything a good character should be, nice appearance, good personality, and an unoriginal but still nice backstory to him. Most important of all he was relatable, but when he becomes strong he loses almost all of those perks. Even the backstory and background doesn’t become too useful because they don’t ever really need to use it after he gets strong. Because we get it now you’re literally stronger than everyone, you used to be that now you’re this. The only thing he has going for him is that he looks pretty badass at times, I’ll give him that but that mostly goes to the art. Well speaking of which the Manhwa does have its good points, which is the art. The art was really good to look at, sometimes I just sat there and didn’t care wtf was actually going on. I was just looking at the art and appreciating it. That is one thing I can guarantee you will like, the art is very respectable and is what carries the Manhwa mainly. But that ending is not there either, the actual light novel ending was like 20+ chapters. You wanna know how many chapters there were in this Manhwa for the ending? It was one. One that I’m not really satisfied with, one that doesn’t feel good enough, one that could’ve been so much better. The actual pacing overall isn’t really that good, because with the first three dungeons he’s still learning and becoming stronger which was nice and pretty cool to see. But then he immediately gets stronger so fast right away, which then makes everything so predictable and uninteresting now. After all that, it’s difficult for me to say that I can recommend this to you. I really wanted to enjoy this and like this and put it as one of my favorites. But I just can’t because of the dumb repetitiveness and cycle this Manhwa continuously gives me. Although I managed to finish it and I did enjoy some of it, I mostly felt bored and empty a lot of the time too. Especially when other characters were around and when characters died, still felt empty and annoyed. Like I said in the beginning, you will either like it or hate it. I’m in the middle, so I don’t know what to tell you. I would recommend reading the first 1-50 chapters, and see if you can go on from there. 5/10."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Pretty entertaining for a powerfantasy reverse isekai manhwa. The author uses some cliché tropes, but the execution is not bad. Characters other than the protagonist (a Edgy Mary Sue) aren't really fleshed out and are just there because the main character would be too lonely, I guess the author thought that, because they're generic, without development, specially the female characters. Plotwise the story is consistent until the Jeju Island Arc, keeping you hyped all the time, after that it goes downhill, rushed as fuck, and just forgets about characterization for real lmao. The art is really great, and character design is cool as well. To ... be fair I kinda enjoyed as a guilt pleasure. It isn't that good, but not a waste of time, if the premise got you interested, go on."}, {"score": "4", "content": "The Story: 2/10 The concept is fairly interesting with dungeons springing up in the world and hunters who clear them for the riches inside and to prevent the monsters from escaping to prey on humanity. The major problem is that the world-building is atrocious . Anything can be completely changed or discarded at will. There is never any tension in the story after the first ark as MC becomes a Gary Stu and plot armour is there to ensure a victory whenever things get slightly close. The author also has extremely limited knowledge in game systems and economies and almost every time they come up(which is ... very often in a game system narrative) he makes a fool of himself and the world. The Art: 9/10 It's really good. Character/monster designs are sharp and distinctive. Good use of art style for comedic effects. The SFX texts, UI elements and use of space is all excellent. This is the selling point of the manwha and the only reason I'm not completely baffled that it has a high rating. The Characters: 4/10 This is a generous 4, owing a lot to the visual design of the characters. There is only 1 character that matters in this and it's the MC. Side characters are extremely flat and only exist to further the plot with minor exception to the world-building characters that we see POV's from occasionally. The MC is one of the most generic self-insert characters around. Claims to be dungeon diving for his family but barely interacts with them at all. His motivation is unclear for most of the story after his given ones are disproved. Characters are often forced to act illogically in order to progress plot Enjoyment: 7/10 Large caveat of you have to turn your brain off while reading(don't ask questions), but the manwha can be a lot of fun going from one epic fight to an even grander one a few chapter later. The pacing is faster than most and brings some excitement to see new things so often. Overall: 4/10 This is a manwha best enjoyed binged as a form of visual filler. There is no meat to be had here; without world-building or interesting characters this is a pretty snack at best. Below average, but a fun ride if you can turn off your mind."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Review written at ch165 So I love this Manhwa. I have been reading this around the time it first came out. Solo Leveling generally fallows your generic op mc type story. the story itself is kind of weak. and the mc himself is kind of boring. He really only has 2 emotions which is to get angry at some characters and worried for his family. But the story and emotions aren't why I read Solo Leveling. I read it to watch him beat the crap out of his enemies. The author I think does a good job at making me hate the people he beats ... up. I don't care that the chance of him losing adds another decimal place every chapter. I think that's why so many of us read this Manhwa. We just like watching him win."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Damn, what a read. It's a manhwa that people argue whether or not it's amazing or just mediocre. I typically hate mangas that have been popularized lately, with the obvious \"main character was weak but becomes strong because of...\", essentially a power fantasy that is just so boring for me to read, personally, as there is no creativity to it. Solo Leveling follows the same plot points as any other generic power fantasy. The protagonist was weak, but gets the \"gamer power\" and becomes strong, saving everyone. Then, why is it praised so much? There are two glaring reasons why it's getting so adored, even worshipped at times - ... the art and the story. - Now, let's get this out of the way quickly. The art is gorgeous. It stands out as their own style which I don't think most artists can copy in such short times to be released, the coloring makes it very distinct and the composition for every single battle makes it all so coherent and amazing. You can very clearly see how well it was done, and how much it improved as time went on. If I could explain the art in one word, it would be \"clean\". Obviously, you can nitpick at some points of the artstyle being bad, but most of the time you can see how much hard work Solo Leveling had. I personally would give it a 10/10, and if there would be an anime, it will be either amazing due to the art source material already feeling like animation, or downright horrible - there would be no in-between. - Now, the second and final part is the story. Yes, it's generic. It follows plot points that are predictable and the power fantasy is still there. The biggest reason following the artstyle though is how well it was done. The story digs deeper into the mystery of it all, something most power fantasies tend to ignore or rush to. It doesn't go one stop and then moves on to the other. Every action of all characters affects the other, every mistake is shown and the world building for something so generic can't be this much fun to explore, but it is! I very much enjoyed the monsters the most, and the protagonist's journey around them. The biggest failure I feel like it could have done differently is that we know the protagonist will always win, and always will be the knight in shining armor, which I had hoped it would remove itself from. But that's something it almost never does. We see the protagonist getting hurt, sure, but we know that he's going to win eventually. What is good about Solo Leveling is that it doesn't just happen because of the power of friendship, it's never that. The whole point of Solo Leveling is in the title; \"Solo Leveling\". He does most things alone (arguably at times), and needs to actually use his brain rather than brawn. The issue is still present though, even if some characters get to shine at times, the protagonist would eventually save everyone. - There's an \"ending\" and a battle that I personally felt was very rushed, controversial, and was a letdown, the battle was not up to par with the others. The battle I felt wasn't composed so very well, making it incredibly hard to understand what was going on, something Solo Leveling hasn't had this much issue with. The \"ending\" isn't the conclusion to the whole story and there will be a continuation for the \"actual ending\", meaning I won't judge that too harshly, but it did affect the manhwa as a whole. It was a build-up that felt like it didn't deserve and removed most, if not all of the consequences. I really hope the final conclusion of the story isn't like that, and I will change the review if it doesn't stay with the ending with it did. - Overall, I enjoyed it a lot. There are almost zero times I felt confused, felt like any parts of the story just needed to be rushed with the exception of the \"ending\". I would say that it's a perfect pick for most people that would want to start reading manga/manwhas that also likes action. There are definitely problems that affected the story, it was at times a disappointment how formulaic it was, but the enjoyment was still there throughout."}, {"score": "9", "content": "It's power fantasy in its purest form, and whilst the last few chapters feel as though they simply rush to a conclusion, the journey up until that point is great, with every bit of power that the protagonist gains along the way feeling earned, or at least explained in a way that is understandable within the setting. I know you've heard it already, but the art is simply phenomenal. As my first real introduction to webtoons back in 2019, this did not disappoint at all, and opened me up to a whole new world of content I would have otherwise missed out on. It's honestly worth a ... read, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece as ultimately the core ideas are not anything exceptionally unique, but the ideas that are there are polished to such a high standard that it's easy to overlook. My only real gripe is that outside of the MC and his closest summons, side characters can be underdeveloped somewhat in comparison, which is understandable as there are so many of them. But f in the chat for demon waifu, the story may have forgotten you but I haven't. Very solid 9/10 :)"}, {"score": "8", "content": "To be honest, I don't even care about story, I don't care if the writing was made by a 8 year old playing with his toys, I only care about the art. Solo Leveling is an artistic masterpiece. It's simply beautiful, marvelous, perfect. Each of the panels of each fight has it's own beauty. Before starting to read Solo Leveling, I was kind of unmotivated because it felt generic and superficial, but I started reading and the art made me continue reading. Other reviews will say various things about the characters and the story, but I can say two things: The art is beautiful, and ... the manhwa is enjoyable. It's worth the read."}, {"score": "7", "content": "-Vague Spoilers for solo leveling- Here's a good comparison i just thought of: Solo Leveling is just like me when I'm running, i start quite strong but starts to falter around the end. Season 1 was way better than season 2, not saying that the first season was god-like or anything but it was certainly better. Story (7/10): The story is basically this: a weak guy gets strong. It's a very simple concept but very easy to screw up in the long run. Wich we've seen with countless works of fiction. But it stays consistent in solo leveling until a certain point. You could feel the stakes ... in season 1, there was actually a chance of the people dying, like in the island-raid. I think the world-building was quite fascinating, unfortunately it did not really capitalize on it. The balance between guilds all over the world for example could have been a good way to expand the world and see how other countries deal with the gate phenomenon. The monarch and ruler stuff also felt really far-fetched, wich also goes for a reveal about the main-character late into the manwa, the system was one of the big aspects of what made this series interesting and yet the author just threw it away for a power-up :/ The power system is not very good, it limits itself greatly. Hunters are ranked into categories of E till S rank, what sucks here is that you basically have to get lucky to get any higher up in these rankings. You can only get stronger through a \"double- awakening\" wich does not require anything. It's just kind of random. This would not be a big problem if people could just train themselves to get stronger, but they can't, it doesn't matter how hard you work you will always stay in the rank you've been given unless you get lucky. There is also one more rank higher than S, but i don't think it's worth talking about. Art (9/10): The art is REALLY good, it looks very vibrant and the art really elevates the battles to new heights. It's probably the strongest point of the manwa. Character (4/10): As you can see from the score this is the weakest point of the story, many characters are just tools for the narrative without any further purpose, character-development is also abysmal. Oh yeah, most females also have the main-character syndrome. Once they see how strong and cool Jin-Woo is they all fall for him instantly, sigh. Exceptions do exist however, i will list down the characters that were decent here: the Chairman, Sung Jin-Woo and..... oh wait that's it. And because of the nature of the story nobody can really do much in combat either, they just get bodied every single time. This should not have been the case, even if you can't make good characters, putting them in combat with a interesting way of fighting automatically heightens the enjoyment of a character, even if that's all they have. It just feels like Jin-Woo is the only one capable of anything against the monsters coming from the gate, we've seen the opposite in the early parts of the story, but the power-creep is just draging the story's best aspect (the fights) down. making the characters stepping stones is rarely a good idea, and it's not an exception here. Sound: So naturally there is no soundtrack since it's a manwa, but there is a mv made for it once the series finished. It's called \"Echo\" by THE BOYZ. I personally think the song kinda slaps for a K-Pop song. Enjoyment (8/10): Every aspect combined made it quite a fun read, despite its flaws. I would recommend trying it out for yourself. Overall (7/10): I was over the moon about this manwa when i finished it, and then i started thinking, and the more i did that, the more i realized its flaws. Solo Leveling is a decent read with good fights and some good comedy every now and then, but don't expect too much from the story or characters. Oh right, the ending was also way too ambitious. Thanks for your time, ~Sirus"}, {"score": "7", "content": "Solo Leveling is at a surface level just the same old manhwa with an overpowered protagonist who suffers no consequences and gains all the rewards and who is made to simply be badass with no good story telling or character development, and at a deeper level it's the same thing. It lacks in many places the only thing that really shines in this story is the power fantasy and that is really all that it is. I would give it a such a high rating for a simple reason, it may be very basic with nothing knew to offer however reading it is ... like a guilty pleasure with how entertaining the fights can be (even more so with the amazing art), however binge reading it can be quite hard as it does get quite boring because the story is just like grinding in any video game, doing the same thing over and over for the same reward. At first the reward is great but eventually it gets stale which is why you can only read this story from time to time. Overall 6.5/10 (since you can put point in the rating I put 7)."}, {"score": "8", "content": "\"I shall say it once more. I am the record of your struggles, the evidence of your resistance, and the reward of your pain.\" Solo Leveling. One of the most popular manhwas in recent times, known for how overpowered its protagonist, Sung Jin-Woo, got, how his origins were at the bottom, how he rose from the ranks of \"World's Weakest Hunter\" to someone even the strongest would fear. In its essence, it embodies the worst parts of a trash isekai fantasy that someone would discard after a few chapters, a story arc or two, for being unrealistic. And while Solo Leveling embodies those tropes, it also ... manages to deliver on them well, never descending to the level of a typical self-insert story. What helps its case? Consistency. Sung Jin-Woo isn't a person who gives up easily - that part of his personality has always been present. He is a keen, observant, persevering fellow. Even in the very first Cartenon Temple incident, we can see how, despite lacking the power to do so, he fends off all attacks on him and his team. So when he is granted this special power by the 'system', it is not unsurprising that he strives to improve himself, that he tries to fix whatever it is about him that was an obstacle in the past. He is able to break past his limits purely because he strives. For betterment, and for power. (And also because he is \"ever so slightly\" lucky). The manhwa is widely acclaimed as one of the greats, and for good reason. The art is stunning, even in the most minor of scenes, and the action is wonderfully crafted. The characters are all distinct and memorable. The story itself never really drops much in quality, as each arc presents new challenges to \"The Player\", as he slowly levels up. The monarch storyline was a bit confusing at first, but the manhwa used exposition cleverly - it dumped information on the reader thrice, but never made it overwhelming, and made it quite understandable. The history, the war, the rivalry, they were all touched on just enough for the reader to understand what had happened, was happening, and would happen. Some readers were dissatisfied with the ending, and there is part of it that could be considered strange. I personally liked it, as it put on display, once again, the part of \"Shadow Monarch\" Sung Jin-Woo that humanises him after all that he has become - he cares not only for himself, but for everyone around him. He believes that, since he has this power, he should protect those who don't. He is willing to sacrifice a large part of his life to singlehandedly take up the responsibility of ending this long-lasting war without loss of innocent life. That noble desire in itself is what separates him from the other monarchs - a lack of desire for ultimate power and domination, and a will to restore peace. That was the good. The bad is not as prevalent a trait in this manhwa, but is certainly present. It is a problem many other creations face, and one that Solo Leveling, no matter how hard it may have tried, could probably not have fully gotten rid of - underused side characters. One example of this would be Guild Leader of the White Tigers' Guild, Baek Yoonho, among other guild leaders. He is one of the first to recognise Sung Jin-Woo's potential, and how he is a hunter that can continuously grow. Yet, once the Jeju Island Raid is completed, he is quite literally sidelined till the very end. There is a valid argument to be made here - he, and the other leaders, had simply fulfilled their purpose in the story. And that argument is understandable. So there should be another example. And there is. Sung Jin-Woo's father, Sung Il-Hwan. He is never really present in the story, and appears in only four or five chapters, in total. He is never made to be a character that the reader should really care about, only one that is present here and there, someone who has some relation to the protagonist. It's not even a situation where Sung Jin-Woo is actively trying to seek him out - all we are told is that, 4 years ago, he left and never came back. Thus, when he dies, it isn't as impactful as it could have been if we saw even some scenes with him being a part of Sung Jin-Woo's life before hunters. But there was nothing. All the scene had going for it was the reaction of Sung Jin-Woo and his mother, who would obviously be saddened by his death. Another side of this problem is underintroduced characters. Antares, the Destruction Monarch, along with the Transfiguration Monarch, would be great examples of this. The Destruction Monarch, only ever mentioned by name, only talked about as a support for the Shadow Monarch, was suddenly a foe that could conquer armies. Yet this was understandable, as his power had been somewhat hinted at. However, the Transfiguration Monarch, never even mentioned before, was somehow the one controlling all the troops fighting the war. Never had he even been mentioned, and it felt odd that a story so dedicated to make its power system well-constructed, would resort to such methods. That should be the end of such a fine manhwa - some flaws, but an overall great experience. However, there is one part left. After the manhwa ended, there were roughly 20 more chapters worth of side-stories. While they are apparently from the original and Ragnarok novel series, I shall limit my exploration of these stories to to chapters of the manhwa that I read. At first, I quite liked the concept - Sung Jin-Woo returning to normal life after having worked tirelessly for so long, to a world where nobody would ever know how much he sacrificed, yet one where those he loved would be alive and well. Even though some disliked him ending up with Hunter Cha, it was not an ending that I personally rejected, as it had been somewhat built up to. My favourite chapter of them all was the one where we spend almost 300 pages in the Repose, where Igris is the narrator. Something always made Igris interesting to me, so seeing such a long chapter from his perspective, how he narrated his own journey, really hit the right spots. The problem lies in the last five chapters. Even if these are alternate dimensions, it seems a tad bit unrealistic that Sung Jin-Woo's son, a high schooler, would be able to clear the 100-floor demon tower in a day. The problem is mainly due to one obvious reason - Sung Su-Ho levels up to 99 in a mere day, with none of the abilities Jin-Woo had, bare handed, by fighting regular monsters over and over. However, this is believeable, as even Jin-Woo did level up by constantly fighting. I justify too much, but I do so for a reason. Despite all the problems prevalent in the side stories, and how the action became slightly harder to follow (or maybe I'm just dumb), there is a somewhat satisfying conclusion - Sung Su-Ho, just like his father Sung Jin-Woo, will continue to strive for power, as the will to protect and survive has certainly been passed down."}, {"score": "7", "content": "(Finished main story, yet to finish epilogue) I was reading through some negative reviews of this series and seeing a common denominator. I think people are mad that a power fantasy that sticks to a repetitive formula where the main character suffers no longlasting consequences got hyped over their own beloved series that does the same. I also started reading this because I wanted to see why this was praised as one of the best things ever written. It's not that I'm disappointed, I had a lot of fun reading this, and I hold a great appreciation for the artist and writer, also I'm not ... ever going to read the light novel and we may be missing out on the missing internal development of characters that people are craving. But this isn't the mindblowing experience I thought it would be, it's not a 10/10, it is just fine, rather fun in its power fantasy moments and I enjoyed watching the ever-escalating calamities and overpowered protagonist fighting said calamities. So lemme set that aside, just temper your expectations and be realistic when maybe running into this series. That said, I do recommend this as an entry to manhwa that fulfill the same role as shonen power fantasties in Japanese manga. I'm no expert in the field, I've really only read 3 action manhwa (the Pick Me Up Infinite Gacha, Omniscient Reader, and Towed of God), but my own addictive personality and reading style made me rush through this series and I put the other ones on hold because I saw I was reaching the end. The opening maybe 100 chapters are really fun and addicting, you get to see how Sung Jinwoo keeps growing and adapting to his environment with an iron will and a deeply overpowered god ability saved only for him. You kind of get to this point in the story and truly understand this man will not be defeated so easily, to the point that the world has to continue getting stronger and more overpowered to balance the sheer power. Once the series gets to the point where there's infighting between countries and their top hunters, you see the dick measuring matches happen all the time, I sort of took a break, not because I didn't like what I was reading but because I could see that the repetitive formula of our protag was getting a little old and I wanted a breath of fresh air. The apocalypses and destruction grow grow grow and then by chapter 130 or so, you're nearing the last 50 chapters and you can see the end. Art, which seemed to be everyone's top agreement, it's beautiful, I can see the immense amount of work that went into this and I really praise the art team on this one. And I want to say that I'm sorry at a certain point I became a speedreader because the fight that was occurring was a little blurry and difficult to follow, I just wanted to proceed to the narrative that follows the action. No shame in the game, sometimes you're pressed for time and watch to say you read a chapter. The creature design was fun and I really liked their palette swap when they turned into army of the undead. The characters were fine, varied in their quality. Oh boy do I wish we got more development on the other characters but I understand with such a gigantic cast of characters, it's hard to get depth. Even Jinwoo's shadows got some funny development through the series, more than some human characters. I have just read a bit of the epilogue and have no idea what's to come but I think the ending was inferior to the journey, which may often be the case in these power fantasy things. The end result is bittersweet in many regards and I have no idea what the remaining 20 chapters of epilogue have for the story but we shall see. I think for my final verdict, the 10/10 story and masterpiece that people claim this to be, I see that for the first half, when we're figuring out the dungeon system, when we're introduced to the inequalities and problems that are amplified in a society where there is an innate quality of superiority in people who gain powers. Once you start to discover the reason the whole power system exists, the excitement lay in the mystery of what is to come, and less on how Sun Jinwoo will beat the upcoming antagonist(s). Then, the cool, edgy protag that becomes so overpowered, reality is rewritten and undone and all these crazy things, if that is within your wheelhouse, if you love that satisfying moment of victory where the chad remains over the rubble and they're doing their little confident smirk and everyone's praising that character, if THAT really gets you going, this one is for you. If you want a fantastic story that gets better as you go, with depth and mystery and drama, that's not the end result. This is a fine introduction to how the rpg system of leveling up is done with fancy gamer screens and cool effects, and I vastly enjoyed most of this. And I'm gonna get through the epilogue. This had me hooked, then it got a little too repetitive for me, then I reflected on its cultural impact like wow this really does it for people, and then I thought that the end was eh it was alright yeah, and for that, it gets a 7/10. 7.5 if it were allowed but yeah it's worth diving into, and then dip if it doesn't catch your fancy once the world becomes bigger with more countries and more players and more threats."}, {"score": "9", "content": "All of the fights, cinematography, and overall story were awesome. The main reason this show isn't getting a 10 from me is the very miniscule relationship development throughout the story. It's good that they got together in the end, and it wrapped up nicely. The main character is weirdly suspicious of everyone throughout the entire show because he assumes until proven otherwise that their overall intention is malicious, which is kind of weird. Even though hes super mega OP, I hardly see the reason he worries so much. I really enjoy using the main characters shadow creatures as a means for comedic relief since the main character ... basically loses his emotions through certain events in the show, making him too silent or serious pretty often."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Hi everybody who read my quick thoughts: In my opinion Solo Leveling is a good work, I see why it is rated high. The manhwa's tempo is really quick and sometimes it is slow, but the quick fights are dominant. If you want to read slower paced works, I can recommend you The Gamer. The story is simple, not a very complex one. First I think the main character's \"solo leveling\" is too OP :D He very quickly gets everything, he is a special one. I think those who read it, everybody want to became guy like him. The atmosphere, the artwork of this work is brutal. Very beautiful ... and detailed. I give to Solo Leveling 9/10"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Typical power up fantasy from zero to hero. Execution is very good. Even when story have basically nothing but grind and struggles of MC on his way to become the strongest, it still keeps you engaged. Lore dump in late second half was bothersome and meaningless. Whole thing with kings, sovereigns, monarchs and stuff was dumb and pointless, but thankfully it did not detract much from main attraction. It is very basic and can me summed up as \"Me likes no war. You likes war. Me kills you before you kills me. Then no war\". I think story could be better if MC was not made ... oblivious or motivations of powers that moved the plot was left vague. Author mention some concepts and questions that he could explore to improve plot, but he abandons them pretty quickly in the name of level grind and battles. Epilogue chapters move in that better direction but it is too late and they have almost no impact and little on character development. They feel mostly empty because how late they come in story. Not sure what to say about art or composition. This is my first manhwa and it was bizarre experience at how inconvenient image and text placement is."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Solo Leveling is a really great story to read. It's a low fantasy story which is really uncommon in Animanga, there's more high fantasy than low fantasy out there so being a low fantasy story already creates a lot of interest. Instead of taking place in a highly magical world, it's just the normal Earth we all live in but magical creatures have invaded our world and Hunters are sent to shut down the gates they're trying to cross over from. A really great concept and pretty great execution. Solo Leveling is nearly a masterpiece I'd say, the characters and character dynamics is great, story telling ... is insanely good, the art is amazing, character development is great. Personally I think the story peaked around arc 16 and then stagnates, but just because it stagnated doesn't mean it degraded in quality, you just never saw the highs like you did in arc 16 in my opinion. The only thing holding back Solo leveling from being a masterpiece was the ending to the main series, the ending felt like it wasn't meant to be the ending at all, it felt so out of place and honestly was super disappointing to see considering how good everything was up to that point. I held onto hope that the epilogue taking place after the main events would rectify things but it felt like fan service to make up for the ending to be honest. I didn't hate the epilogue but it just felt like a means to make up for that ending to the main series in order to make fans happy and I wasn't exactly excited about it.

Art: Ok yeah, if you have eyes you can agree that its 10/10. some very talented people working on this project. fast af release pace considering. character: the biggest problem with the series. horrid focus on characters. Tons are introduced and then dropped without ever being explored (this is a ... recurring theme with all characters). very few motivations are really explored other than MC. to summarize they all exist to make the MC look cool and then become an afterthought. very poor writing and if you have read the LN than you will see that the writing becomes derivative quite quickly. tl/dr: Nice world building, stakes dont become too boring.

However, most of the characters in solo leveling are pretty forgettable. Not only that but the story itself was mediocre at best and I found it pretty predictable.

So if you just ... wanna read something that is like and battle shonen or an isekai with a overpowered main character the read solo leveling.

It shares some odd similarities with One Punch Man, in that the art is by far the most outstanding quality in it's favour, and also that the main character is the least interesting one around. I will freely admit that the story simply doesn't appeal to me on a personal level. While edgy loners seem to be all the rage, I don't see much appeal in an antisocial loner being the best at everything in a story, which would normally be defined by characters and their interactions, especially when the plot itself notes the MC as explicitly 'special' ... with his status as the Player. The setting, while nothing original if you've picked up any modern Korean works, is decently well explored, the community of hunters and how they interact with dungeons, each other, and the world at large gets a fair amount of explanation. The characters are bland at best. The dark, sullen lone wolf MC is the only one with significant screentime, and when he isn't really interesting enough to make me care about the story, seeing the other characters being used only to frame how cool and edgy he is is borderline painful. As someone who's deep into the light novel scene and has gone through a ton of Korean novels with similar premises, seeing others lavish praise onto this work feels like seeing people watcing Dragon Ball Z be aired for the first time, from the perspective of someone who has seen modern shounen. Works such Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint or The Novel's Extra do much more interesting things with the same blend of modern Korean sensibilities and extravagant fantasy elements.

Frankly I was blown away and I was already expecting a masterpiece, I finished this entire thing in 3 days whilst also having uni every day I simply could not put it down once I started reading. An immensely captivating read, so immersive and so damn exciting it really felt like the characters and art was jumping right off the page. I'd like to speak more about the art, as this was my first manhwa I was surprised when I found out it was all gonna ... be in colour and oh my goodness was I absolutely absorbed in so many of these drawings. I was saving panels as I read and I ended up with 297 in my folder, it just got better and better as the series went on I had to sit and bask in pages sometimes. I adored the colouring and lighting effects present throughout so much of this read and man the hype moments were just so brilliantly done. The flow and energy of the panels were exciting and made me feel like I was actually watching a battle go down with how it all moved and linked together it was just such a pleasure to read. In terms of the characters I gotta hand it to the goat himself Jin-woo. God what a cool dude, I thought going into this he'd go down the typical \"edgy\" protagonist route but nope that guy was cold and badass and literally just exactly how you'd want a character to be in a story like this like he was seriously flawless and through all he was going through he still had his sweet and thoughtful moments I was just in awe at how much I enjoyed watching his development. I really really liked the side characters too, from all the hunters to the shadows to the friends and family there was not a single one who felt annoying or useless they all brought so much life and I loved the relationships within the story everything felt so connected and real it was such a joy. Cha Hae-in was another stand-out character I adored her, Esil was great too and also shoutout Beru my goat!!!! Speaking more about the story I cannot overstate how enjoyable it was to experience, once again at the start I truly had no idea what to expect but I was blown away at how everything led up perfectly to the climax and how every little story beat remained relevant and helped to shape everything properly for the plot. There were so many insane stand-out moments throughout the entire read, moments that got your heart racing or got you tearing up or got you damn near cheering the characters on like this was just such a ride and I'm so glad I rode it. Overall this was a phenomenal piece of fiction that I will now be eternally recommending to anyone and everyone this was a wonderful experience and I will now do nothing but think about this for weeks to come woo goodbye productivity hello rereading and watching hundreds of youtube vids!!!"}, {"score": "8", "content": "This is a great story, especially at the beginning. Unfortunately it doesn't maintain the quality the whole time, especially at the end, where it felt a bit rushed. When you like something you really want it to be as close to perfect as it can be. While this story generally gives it's characters respect, sometimes it teases a greater purpose in the plot (Hae-In Cha, and Esil Radiru also deserved better) but then they never actually matter that much. So when interesting characters that could have contributed a lot to the story, just stop existing in the story after the Main Character is done with ... their particular section of plot, you get a little salty that your new favorite character didn't get more screen time. Just keep in mind that I still recommend the story. After reading that, you might think this story sounds pretty mediocre. The thing is that I actually really enjoyed this story. It has a lot of really interesting ideas, and for the most part it delivers on those ideas pretty well. A reality where people gain D&D like fantasy powers, and are basically superheros is a compelling enough concept. This takes that concept, and adds the ultimate power fantasy element by making the main character the only person who can gain experience and level up. The main character starts as literally the weakest person to still have enough powers to register as someone with powers. There's the promise of seeing them grow, not only more powerful, but as a person as well. It is very enjoyable to see them progress through the story, and slowly realize their potential. Unfortunately that leads into my biggest complaint with the story. You saw me bring it up in the first paragraph. The main character is usually the only character that we get to see grow, and become something greater, throughout the course of the story. Now not every character in a story needs to be important, and it's fine to leave side characters to do their own thing and have the story move on. The issue is that a lot of characters show up and act like they will matter a lot later on, only to get sidelined before ever doing anything that matters. There's is so much potential for a lot of these characters, many of which were fan favorites, but they feel like they were dropped before tying their interests up, which makes them feel a little pointless, or underdeveloped. As an example Jin-Woo Sung has like 4 different potential love interests that show up throughout the story, and not a single one of them ever actually goes anywhere despite being teased throughout the story. They exist to be saved, or to be easy on the eyes, and rarely anything more. Supposedly in the web/light novel Sung Jin-Woo does actually go somewhere with one of them, but that's not in the the Manhwa, so it doesn't count for the Manhwa. I mentioned a character \"Esil Radiru\" in the opening paragraph, and she is a great example. Sung Jin-Woo liberates her people who exist in another dimension that he can visit. She aides him in finding his way through this dimension, and she shows that she has a great level of respect for him, and is a valuable ally, with potent abilities. In chapter 88, once he gets what he wants from her dimension, he leaves her, and he never returns to her dimension ever again. He even tells her he might return some day, implying to the audience that the story intends to come back, but it never happens. Each arc has many characters introduced, and named, as if the world is living and breathing, and they will continue to exist, and could come up again in the future, but the vast majority never do anything meaningful after the arc of their initial introduction. All of that said, In the end, all the relevant plots get resolved, and there's aren't any glaring holes to point at. However if you grew attached to any character besides Sung Jin-Woo, or a hand full of others that are necessary to the plot, you'll probably feel like a few plot holes still exist. They aren't really important in the grand scheme of the story, and they won't matter to most of the readers, but for those of us that wanted to see these characters, or side stories, get tied up, it will feel lacking. It really would have helped if the story just popped back in once or twice to see where they are when all is said and done. Despite all of those complaints, and all of the hopes I had for various forgotten characters, it is still an enjoyable story. The end felt a little rushed, and possibly leaning towards being a bit generic, but it executed it's premise without any major stumbles, and stuck the landing. It's an exciting ride all the way through. Although I complain a lot about characters rarely showing up again in any meaningful way, when the story does feature returning characters, they almost always have a good reason to be there, and they play a fitting role that makes sense for who they are in the story. Overall, I give the story an 8/10. Pretty enjoyable. I hope the anime does it justice."}, {"score": "6", "content": "52 chapters in and its very disappointing from what i expected its heavily focuses on the main character and the side character are just there to make the mc even more powerful every antagonist so far is ass there was a goal for the mc then the author just forgot all about and changed it to becoming the best hunter honestly this is very overrated by the people who think this a ten out of ten the only thing i liked was the mc's development but now its just getting repetitive fight a dungeon win and achieve a new power enjoyment wise this is good ... but everything else cant live up to its glory of a manhwa i hope we get a good side character for once and not just focus on the mc overall a 6.5/10"}, {"score": "4", "content": "This manwha is amazing in terms of art, action and suspense it does all of those amazingly! Do I recommend this manhwa at all? No, I would not recommend it as it's cons outweigh the pros of this manhwa. Many times has this manhwa felt rush and and all it could compensate was it's amazing art but it's all show but no substance. I'll start off with the stuff I think the manga did okay or great in so you can see if any of these interest you. Pros - *Amazing art and action. It doesn't take a genius to tell you that this manhwa is beautiful ... in every panel. It serves great atmosphere, chilling panels and just terrifying monsters to see. *A lot of content. This manhwa has really really long chapters especially towards the end so if you like to read a hefty amount of dialogue then it's good for that *The protagonist. MAN IS HE A BADASS CHARACTER, like he's so powerful that the action gets amplified a thousand times *Actual threats. Even if you were a hunter in the world, you'd probably die quite easily because the world isn't built for your success or in your favor and it's great to see even if your in the \"awakened\" doesn't mean your special and the suspense you get seeing if the characters will die or not due to how much stronger they are compared to the hunters That's pretty much all I can say it does okay on. Now let's talk about the cons and I promise you, there's a lot of flaws. Cons - *Too much focus on the MC. This doesn't give the other characters more time to shine and most of the problem solving gets resolved by the MC just because he is OP *Forgettable characters. They introduce quite a lot of characters but even then you probably don't even know their name and I can only name like 3 characters but obviously not their full name Cha hae in, Yoo Jin Ho and Thomas Andre. Because the 3 are the ones who get the more rememberable scenes out of all the side characters but even then it's minuscule compared to the MC. Does anybody even remember the demon girl in the hell floors or the ginger hair healer girl in the beginning? *Generic. As much I enjoyed this most out of the other power fantasies it's still painfully generic. MC is OP because he did something and now he gets bitches. Well he doesn't cause his kinda dense until the last few chapters. *Rushed story. Anybody who reads this know despite it having long and plenty of chapters it feels too rushed and you can definitely feel that the author tried to pack a lot of stuff but clearly still didn't have enough time or chapters to do so. This includes the romance between Sang Jin-woo and Cha Hae In. It was more of a one sided love and the author just tried to force a ship between them. They don't have much chemistry with each other so if this had like 50 more chapters this would have been at least a 7 for me. Unfortunately the artist passed away, despite the rushed I won't slander the art. *Meaningless story points. There are quite a few points in the story that makes it feel pointless, for example the School gate incident. It didn't feel like it provided anything other than to give the MC's sister trauma which didn't add much to the story at all *Mediocre writing. There are many points in which the writing just doesn't feel right or the characters don't feel realistic. *The ending. Absolutely dogshit, some time travel bullshit making all the chapters except the last 3 a waste. All that build up for the MC to just reset and waste the deaths and developments of characters in which they still got little of? You can see I wrote a lot more cons than pros and this isn't just because I did it on purpose these are literally my thoughts on the series. I struggled trying to think more than 3 things amazing or okay in this manhwa and I don't hate this manhwa frankly it had a lot of potential but unlike the MC's power it has a limit and it doesn't go high.

You'll finish it in a day and re-read it the next. It's just that fun to read. The originality and story, however, are lacking. I can see how some people don't agree with the \"Hype\" surrounding it. It's nothing new, and besides \"grinding\" the story doesn't seem to be going too far. Character development is always good, (Spoilers for the next line) he gradually loses his humanity while he gets more powerful. It is a little forced however, as a timid and scared weakling becoming a heartless ... murderer within 10 chapters is more \"character changing\" as opposed to \"character development\" Personally though, i just love the art style. Simplistic but not lacking, bada*s but not overdone. I was giving it an overall 7 until we met Igris and I fell in love at first sight. I am now addicted to the hype of Solo Levelling and frequently refresh the page for updates.

The MC is so broken that he no longer has flaws. He's never truly challenged and he doesn't really change through the story. The changes that do occur are all superficial, he becomes high level, his build changes, but nothing else truly shifts. If anything as the story persists he comes alien, unemotional, and inhuman. He has no goals, no motivations beyond vague abstractions like being judicious or loving his family. All this is in service of allowing one to impart themselves into the character, to become Sung Jinwoo, because he ... is nothing but a blank slate. However, I don't need to impart myself on a character to self actualize, and I don't find his motivations compelling. Hes not really moved by duty, or love, or care; all his motivation stem back directly to being stronger. Naruto for example has reasons he wants to become stronger beyond the simple act of becoming strong. The Telos of being stronger is not simply the power itself but what being stronger allows one to do. Sung Jinwoo is boring as a result, and everything that happens to him is also boring. Why? Well because you are Sung Jinwoo, and of course you want to succeed. Why can he summon soldiers, well so he doesn't have to rely on anyone else, so he can be above it all. Why does everyone else have to wear equipment and armor, well because he has to look cool and be all black, and also has to provide subtext of being so strong to not even need armor. Why does Cha love him, because he doesn't smell weird and he saved her. However, that doesn't make her special, because he would do that for anyone. Why doesn't he join the Jeju Island Raid earlier, because it wouldn't look as cool as him coming later and winning it easily when everyone else struggled. He let people die simply to look cool and its never addressed. Did every single hunter in the Red Gate deserve to die? Did all deserve to die in Jeju Island. The author realizes this issue which is why he tries to sidelong some excuse as to why its ok that they died, because otherwise he would have to contend with a hero who's kind of evil. And that certainly wouldn't suit a wish fulfillment narrative, where the reader is the main character. This kind of writing is fine in video games where you control the character and as such you kind of become them. This is fine in choose your own adventure of novels, and this is fine in some cases of first and second person narratives, (Think Calvino). This is not ok in a shonuen were self growth is the point because it trivializes it, it is so easy to build power progression and growth but the author neither has the skill or patience for it and that it why Solo Leveling is not good."}, {"score": "7", "content": "Was great at the start, but slowly over the time as the mc grows more and more in power, and outpaces and sheds off the system that brought him so much power, it broadens, to its own detriment.

Which is all shed for the most part by the end, alotta characters not even getting a cameo by the end. The ending was obsoletely the worst part, dropped it a couple rungs at ... least.

They drop a ton of plot threads which they never revisit, make alotta actions they never explain, show off characters who do literally nothing or are never touched upon once again.

Solo Leveling is by no means bad. Its art is great and as far as common tropes such as OP protagonist and game like monster hunting go it's one of the best. However I don't write my reviews to be analytical cause I don't think I'm that smart and I admire any author that manages to successfully bring a story to a close. Instead, my review is based on how it ... made me feel, so how did the story make me feel by the end: \"Damn\" That's the thought I had, I wish we spent more time in the world. Maybe if there was another arc before the ending but I guess when it's time, it's time. Sung Jinwoo's sacrifice is up there with the greatest tragic sacrifices any hero can make and although I wanted anything but that to happen I respect it. It ended with hope, even though most of the people forgot him, he saved everyone and I mean everyone. He has the chance to live in a safe world, rebuild relationships and find new meaning. This with the author's heartfelt message made it a worthy ending to a great series but that wasn't the ending that stayed was it? The Manwha author dying was heartbreaking and I understand doing it in his honour but something about the epilogue felt off to me. Do we really need to see the happy ever after? I get it if you enjoyed seeing a slice of life with Sung Jinwoo, his shadow soldiers and watching his relationship with Cha Hae-In finally solidify but after his son grew up it felt painfully dragged out. I love the story still but I went from wishing I had spent more time in the world to feeling like I had spent too much time in it.

First, I would like to address some of the points people say when they talk shit about this webtoon. The first thing they talk about is \"omg he is so op, so boring he just one-shots everyone\". This is complete and utter bullshit. HE IS NOT OP, HE IS JUST FIGHTING ENEMIES HE CAN DEFEAT AT HIS LEVEL. If you're playing an RPG and your level 22 you not going to fight the level 90 boss because you would get your ass kicked, it's the same thing in solo leveling. He is ... always fighting a monster that was stronger than the last, and he is able to do this because he gets stronger after each fight. You're not op if you're fighting an enemy you can defeat at your current strength. There is one point that I agree on Sung should show some more emotion. He is in some sort of badass/edgy phase which I don't mind. He does show kindness a lot but I would like to see some more emotion from him. Ok, I am done with my rant. story:6/10 with the way the story is set up, it is a little hard to keep a consistent plot. in the early chapters, he just gets the power to level up and he just grinds for a bit defeating monsters, going in dungeons, but in later chapters, he is finding out about a bunch of interesting things like where the monsters come from, the monarchs and the rulers. But the story could be a lot better Art:10/10 Fucking beautiful. characters:5/10 Like I said before the mc is in this badass/edgy phase and he really should show some more emotions. Another problem with the characters is that the mc is really strong compared to the other hunters so we don't get to see them shine too much. And the webtoon did not give the light novel justice. In the light novel the characters had more shine and we stronger (they also talked a lot of shit and could most of the time back it up), but in the webtoon, they took away the shine made them look weak as fuck and they still talked shit. So they would talk a bunch of shit then get their asses kicked right after making them look like a fucking clown.

One day, after entering an E ranked (weakest rank) dungeon with a party, Sung Jin-Woo finds himself in trouble after it turns out to be a double dungeon with overwhelmingly powerful monster statues and boss. Sung Jin-Woo experiences betrayal to the worst degree after more than 70% of his party are wiped out and expected to solve the riddles in ... order to overcome the boss and leave the dungeon. It is from this point where he sacrifices himself as the one responsible for losing most of his party and would be the last moment of his weakness as a surprising game-breaking UI element transforms him forever. As the story progresses, Jin-Woo discovers the world has more to offer than just these gates and monsters as godly entities have been descending on Earth toying with humanity.

One aspect that I enjoyed about Solo-Levelling's plot was how well paced and scaled it was from the beginning. Solo-Levelling stayed mysterious and unpredictable in terms of story direction until the end and at times we'd be shared secret lore of the Universe which would dictate the direction of the story. And as Jin-Woo begins his journey of power levelling, his enemies change from human hunters to dungeon beasts to godly entities which adds a lot of scaling consistency in terms of the story's perspective. However, there are many events in the story that act as pure character development for Jin-Woo such as him killing powerful hunters or going on solo clears; They tend to not be impactful on the story because they get repetitive. Around Chapter 170-179, the pacing and direction of Solo Levelling tank, it feels rushed and there doesn't appear to be response from Jin-Woo's power level system. The monarchs battles last a few chapters when it could have gone more in depth with the detail of Jin-Woo's cup ability and journey in an alternate life. Art: 9/10 Manhwa have adapted to the online comic medium with its vertical layout, complex colors & details, and spaced out panels. Solo-Levelling is no exception; The art is very detailed and manipulates a lot of art and film techniques such as panorama, gradients, shot types etc. to portray dynamic movement in a still medium or emphasize the strength of an opponent and vast landscapes. Outlining, colors and shading in each panel are amazingly detailed and stays consistent throughout the serialization of Solo Levelling. The purple glow radiated by Jin-Woo and his army especially emphasize his strength and shares a visually appealing experience. Overall, Solo-Levelling is a near perfect manhwa. Character: 8/10 Despite being such an amazing manwha and appearing to have no weaknesses, I feel overall character development is more or less the achille's heal of this manwha, since MC becomes overpowered within the first 10 chapters, there's very little space for him to improve as a character. They've tried to make him participate in different quick time pop up dungeons, daily excercise quests and the occasional involvement with other guilds and character quests but it did become fairly repetitive. The fact that MC loses most of his emotion, and that he's aware of it around chapter 30-50 means that we can't really rely on him or other of his hunter-buddies to develop his character - instead, the challenges that he receives not only improves his strength but his 'personality' as a result and as such, he's much more observant and optimistic about others around him. I'd say overall in terms of character development this manwha lies on an 8/10; definitely an amazing experience seeing MC transform from an E ranked hunter to quite possible an SSSS rank hunter (because of his max level summons and ability to learn as he gains experience) but his development could have been diversified or even been more elaborated on (like his guild which is ignored for a while after its establishment). Enjoyment & Overall: 7/10 The first 150 chapters were great and kept me engaged but slowly after that, it began to slowly infer the unsatisfying ending. I was expecting a happier ending with a lot of sacrifice on the line but the boss battle approach in episode 178 left me empty still. I'm also not sure why they have to keep mentioning the psychic hunter lady since she gets more panels than the actual boss fight - I understand that she is an example of Jin-Woo's power radiation but it's such a minor aspect that could have lasted 2 panels. Overall, still a good read but the ending really let me down."}, {"score": "7", "content": "Solo leveling is what made me switch from anime to manga/manwa. It has one of the best art of all the manwas I have seen so far, which made the switch from anime to manga easier for me. The first season is amazing to say the least. Before the second season fully came out, I had read the first season 3 times. The concept was original and somewhat familiar to gamers which made things easier to understand. The fights were drawn really well and were always exciting. The reason why I can't give it a higher overall rating than 7 is because it goes way off path ... in season 2 and I feel like it made things way more complicated than they needed to be, so everything just felt a bit rushed. I also don't feel like the characters are all that amazing, but hey, at least Sung JinWoo is a badass. Overall the manga is good but could've been way better."}, {"score": "7", "content": "Story: 6/10 Mediocre plot. Very predictable. Plot twists are little to none and most are poorly done. Very bland, unengaging, and unimaginative. Art: 9/10 Honestly the only thing going for this is the art. Character: 6/10 Not the worst but they work for a power fantasy like this. Don't take it in the wrong way though. Just like how you don't need well-written characters in hentais, you also don't need the side characters to have much depth in a power fantasy. As long as they do their job and act idiotic and make the protagonist look all-mighty powerful, then they're perfectly fine being 6/10. Enjoyment: 7/10 This ... is the kind of series where you just turn off your brain and enjoy watching the protagonist take down any obstacles and opponents with ease and seeing the side characters are all awed by his strength. It works for like 100 chapters or so but by the end of the series it has gotten so overused and the formula is the same never changing I eventually grew bored. Even the power fantasy is no longer enjoyable. Overall: 7/10 If you like Demon Slayer, you'll love this. This has bad story bad characters, but great art and great enjoyment. So just turn off your brain and you'll enjoy the ride. However, if you want a better recommendation with better story, better characters, better enjoyment that doesn't diminish after dozens of chapters, and also have art that's on par with Solo Leveling, then I suggest you go check out Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint."}, {"score": "7", "content": "Uh... I suppose it'll suffice. This is a wonderful option for individuals who are just getting started with this genre because it is simple to learn. They explain the system's operation in a straightforward and not overly detailed manner. However, as someone who has read a lot of far better manhwas, I consider this to be just mediocre. Maybe there's no excitement anymore because the MC is too powerful? Because the plot is so focused on the protagonist, other characters are often forgotten. The story explains how powerful the others are but does not show them in action and they are KILLED far too easy. Maybe ... it was because the relationship was overly cliched? I'm being biased because I'm not a major lover of romance in fantasy manga, but I don't like the fact that the female lead fell for the mc for a silly reason. I suppose it's enough that she didn't become a bother to the MC, similar to how most webtoons emphasize romance and force the protagonist to reveal his or her flaws to the antagonists. There are also other gaps in the story that the author may have overlooked. But again, it's good enough to be one of my recommendation."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Solo Leveling reviews are often separated into two extremist groups: The Haters, and The Fans Haters hate, fans love. But it's not all that, to be completely honest, first time I read this, it was a complete blast, second time around, not so much. The character developments are not very deep, nor is the story, it's a classic save the world thing, and contains some plot holes that has me thinking, which ruins the experience. But it does one thing right, the characters look cool, the world is immersive, and the fights are well choreographed. The timing of it's release was also done pretty well as it ... was one of the couple in korean manhwas that had that now household leveling up cliche, which certainly made it a bit more unique for it's time, enough for it to be regarded as if it were the father of all leveling up cliches. But for a person that read it for their first manhwa (me), it was an amazing new world, where it took me by surprise, and that's a big part of what's so good about Solo Leveling. Fans are probably people who had SL take the title of their first which isn't bad, but does leave a bit of a biased view. And for those who are sick of the cliche, SL is nothing but a overrated mid series. But both are wrong in that aspect because what it is, is just a rollercoaster ride not in the up and down regard but rather that as long as it has wind flapping in your face, and you're pulling a couple G's, all's good. \"It's not that deep\" is a perfect quote for this situation, sure enough the characters aren't that great, the story isn't all that either, but that's not the point of the series, the point of the series is that it looks visually cool, the action is well made, and the rest are just fillers. They are not the stars of the show but the overall experience users have is nonetheless great. My advice to people who want to see it in a different light or just want to enjoy it, it'd be to stop thinking, and just scroll. Overthinking things that is \"not that deep\" will ruin it, so don't do it."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Well this will be my first review ever . I felt like writing one because this is actually the first time I felt so sad and mad about a piece of art . First of all i would like to say english is not my first language so sorry for the future mistakes i'll be making while writing this , i also just finished my reading so i’m still full of emotion , and dear god bad ones . People are selling Solo leveling as one of the best manhua to actually be published , but let me tell you it’s not . Well ... it’s not bad but it’s not amazing either . Let’s first talk about the story , not very original but who cares ? It’s still interesting to follow in the beginning , the plot is just a random useless guy with no power who just wants to save his mother by becoming a hunter or i don’t even remember the name of the job he's doing ( this shows my interest in this story lol ) . The first chapter was great , you’re thinking “great the cute non talented guy is gonna become the best one “ and you can’t wait to see him evolving . But this is when it becomes kinda bad or at least less good . !!! SPOILER !!!!! The mc is the only character with a development or if we can call that a development , he's just becoming a small dark sasuke or this is what they want us to believe , he’s changing physically ( which is a blessing for our eyes i have to admit ) . His personality, well I don't know if he’s just boring or if he just cares about anybody but himself and some people that are close to him , but you just don’t personally feel close to him . I don’t know if it’s because most of the time I usually like the second character better than the MC but he's just here and winning his battle and I couldn't care less . He’s cute and nice but I just personally didn't feel any attachments to him . I also don’t like how the author is just overpowering him , i understand the whole point of the series is him growing stronger and stronger than everyone else , but he is just winning every battle without any difficulties and the worst in that is THE BATTLE ARE NOT EVEN EXCITING TO WATCH , like if he’s gonna win at least make it cool and exciting to watch , it’s just boring because you know he’s gonna win but there's no challenge in front of him ( hoping it will change in the new arc coming after chapter 155 ) . Let’s talk about the second characters , who were sometimes more interesting than our precious MC. I don’t remember their names because I have a bad memory but also because it’s not like the author wanted us to give them some importance . I’m not gonna talk about the first group of friends our mc had because i don’t care and the author too . About the strongest hunter or whatever you call them , HOW can you tease us with so many strong characters and make them lose every time ????? The pink haired guy with the glasses or the red haired guy who transforms into some kind of white lion were really interesting and you see them a lot but yeah the MC is here so of course they're gonna lose and look useless next to him . But there was this one character I was so mad about , the japanese strongest hunter !!!! The guy has been teased like i have never seen i guy been teased before and he’s just dying like he was nothing in the jeju island arc ( which was by the way such a disappointing arc ) . Reading this arc felt like the author just wanted to give us a little stupid battle between the japanese and korean and guess who’s winning the korean !!! PLEASE it was so boring to read . Let’s go back to the japanese guy , let me give you an example. It's like you are reading or watching one Piece and Shanks, the guy who's been teased since the beginning is dying in his first battle ……...Yeah that would be ridiculously bad . I wanna talk about the romance because there is some type of romance or whatever that is , the blond short haired girl have a crush on our beautiful and talented mc , that’s cute good for her , but we never saw the mc having something for her , like they never had a deep conversation but he suddenly in love with her ??? Like please he was closer to the first red haired girl and he never show any romantic interest for her so it shows how this stupid romance have been built . I’m not gonna say anything else because I don't wanna be mean , I'm still in the heat of my first and probably last reading of this story ( i mean i will not rereading this from the beginning ) It’s not that bad. I've seen worse and at the end I still went to bed at 3am because I wanted to finish reading it , so I guess there is something about it that is kinda addictive , but it’s not as amazing as everyone is saying . I think through reading this story I realized people just love to hype stories for literally doing the bare minimum . I would still continue reading Solo leveling but without any expectations ( maybe it will surprise me ) .

However, a score of 8.8 is very good and via other people and sources I got this recommended, so yesterday I read through all 156 currently available chapters and HOLY **** this was insane! + Humor, hype, ... irony, gorgeous drawings (Black & darkblue; black & deeppurple were enticing combinations, the author's done it flawlessly), colored text has a special meaning (such as extra emphasis), badass characters, action-packed Whenever Jin-woo gets new abilities, I almost couldn't suppress screaming from how cool it looked. - Females don't really have a lot of screentime (Can't remember other criticism for this, but I'll add them if they come to mind) (As this is the first Manhwa I've ever read, this was a refreshing different form compared to Manga lay-out.) Personal score: Story 8, Art 10, character 9, enjoyment 10 (definitely, for me) = overall 37/40 = 9.25 (9, via this system; IMO it's surely worth a 10 so I gave it 10 in my Manga List because enjoyment is what makes or breaks a story)"}, {"score": "6", "content": "The art is amazing - it might be one of the prettiest works of manga/manhwa ever made.

That's it, that's the story. Now, granted, are there things that happen along the way? Sure, but it just feels like an excuse for the MC to progress rather than an actual substantial story.

It is basically an isekai about a giga weak MC becomes giga strong MC. It starts off with another dog pile of a lazy writing. The main character is doing something dangerous because someone they care for is in a hospital. ​Formula of the entire story as followed. MC goes inside dungeon or help some strugglers, if there are side characters have them react to how powerful MC is, MC fights something with no sense of danger, MC gets stronger. Predictable in every sense of the word. That ... is your story, and the worst part about it is the characters. Characters - 1, 0 if possible MC has absolutely no personality besides the \"Im bad ass\" trope. Characters are a god damn joke in this entirely, characters have absolutely no personality. I don't know how it's possible for someone to write a story about an overpowered character and not have side characters that are lovable. In the vein of One Punch Man for example, Saitama isn't really the point of the story. However, OPM still is able to write side characters with character progression and personality. In this Manwha there is absolutely NO, and I mean NO character progression. There are no characters written with something that isn't superficial. None of the characters matter at all, even when there is a sense of danger to them, the MC comes out of no where to save them because the story is so predictable. Art- 7 The only good thing about this at all. The panels with action are terrible in a lot of cases because someone thought it was a good idea to add motion blur? Currently writing this review and it has a 8.79 on MAL and I genuinely have absolutely no clue WHY that is the case. It offers nothing, no good characters, predictable story, and above average art.

As much as putting the blame on the translation is a comfortable excuse for why this series stopped making sense, I think it's also valid to blame the confusing design of characters in the late chapters. It was a mental strain knowing who's a beast, a human, a monarch, a ruler... Let alone understanding who's on who's side and why they're fighting each other. When I think of the early designs for the dungeon beasts and how ... each one of them was unique and memorable, I feel myself beginning to tear up a little bit. Where this Manhwa lacked in character development and maturity, it made it up with epic battle designs and scenery, so it's a shame to see it all fall off towards the end. I was so eager to be done with this Manhwa, so much that the MC's final decision made literally 0 impact on me. Then again maybe it's my fault for expecting a power fantasy Manhwa to be anything but mindless wish fulfillment story where the author gives up half way through.

Adhering to the fantasy and adventure genres, Solo Leveling tells the story of Jinwoo, a teenager who is given special powers, and who is motivated to protect his family. He and fellow “Hunters” stand between their world and a mysterious group of monsters who come to earth through portals called gates. As the story progresses, Jinwoo is gifted more special abilities, and the rules change, following with more of a video-game feel. The manhwa ... has phenomenal art that looks even more beautiful in its printed form. A relative weakness, as described below, is the lack of character depth and the story’s inconsistent quality, as well as the overall lack of consequences by the end of the story. Overall, this may be a great fit for you if you enjoy stories in the fantasy, action, and even sci-fi genres, particularly if you enjoy video-games. Story: 5/10 The plot of Solo Leveling follows Jinwoo as he embarks on a quest to become stronger in order to protect his mother and sister. In the process, as the title suggests, Jinwoo focuses on individually leveling up. You might ask, “What exactly does leveling up entail?” Well, leveling up involves going to a new dungeon, thinking about leveling up, destroying monsters, and then gaining a level and abilities. I will not include spoilers in this review, but I will say that this concept, while quite fascinating, is rather abrupt in the beginning of the story. The reader is introduced to a realistic world with a fantasy twist: there are dungeons in gates, and Hunters destroy monsters to reap rewards. Then, before you know it, there’s a new twist, and some characters can level up. This is a bit jarring, but it is an interesting concept. However, the nature of this leveling up becomes quite monotonous, and that is part of the inconsistency in interest and overall quality of the whole story. Furthermore, there are many situations, such as a “job change,” where the plot overtakes the character and Jinwoo doesn’t have to really make decisions or even explore his internal conflict. This unfortunately detracts from the storytelling, as the reader wants to know what the characters are thinking, but the plot mostly just happens. There’s an upgrade and then immediately another one, and the reader is still unsure what the first upgrade accomplished or how Jinwoo felt about it. Sure, there are physical struggles, but not too many emotional or internal conflicts for Jinwoo. Furthermore, some arcs are quite compelling while others are repetitive, and the main reason for this boringness is because the main character becomes rather bleak and loses track of his original internal conflict and goals. The characters, in general, are another category that is reviewed separately, but they do play a role in the meaninglessness of the plot. In summation, the arcs vary in quality and entertainment: Some are repetitive while others are suspenseful; however, all of the arcs feel as though Jinwoo will not face consequences. Ultimately, this becomes the trend by the end of the story. Once Jinwoo gives that classic stare and says, “Arise,” you know he’s going to be causing mayhem and face minimal consequences for his destruction. To worsen the lack of accountability and ruin the stakes, the final battle is practically omitted from the story using a rather obscure plot twist that, while creative, is self-defeating. Although this review does not contain specific spoilers, it is worth noting that the ending of the story feels anticlimactic for multiple reasons, including the lacking final battle, the major change in characters at the end, and the universal lack of stakes and accountability. This is further exacerbated by the epilogue, which, aside from some humor, detracts from Jinwoo’s story and adds barely any depth to the already pointless side characters. Art: 10/10 The art in the Solo Leveling manhwa is the main attraction. It is perfect for this genre and really brings out the vibes of playing a video-game. It helps the reader to connect with the main character and is quite detailed, supporting in the world-building. Characters: 3/10 Without sharing any specific spoilers, I must share that the side characters are practically irrelevant in this story. Not only do they not matter in the end due to Jinwoo’s actions and the plot, but they are also generally uninteresting. Throughout the story, Jinwoo uses the side characters for motivation and his own gain, but they don’t add anything special to the story, otherwise. Some characters are introduced and written out of the story in one or two chapters, and a lot of the important political figures would have been better introduced earlier in the story. A few characters were hard to follow, as they’d be shown in another country doing something and then re-introduced, with minimal explanation and little background information, 100 chapters later. Beyond the side characters, the story has only the protagonist: Jinwoo. Sure, there are some antagonists, but the main antagonistic doesn’t even get to battle with Jinwoo; instead, he’s just written off as being defeated. He was also unclear throughout the story, which added to the confusing plot. Overall, Jinwoo starts off as a relatable and interesting character, though he falls into the same tropes as many fantasy heroes. He has special abilities that aren’t explained until near the end, and he exploits them for his own gain. Although the mystery of his abilities is interesting, it doesn’t augment his internal struggles, which would have been more remarkable and impactful. This aspect of the writing is particularly unfortunate. While Jinwoo’s situation is more interesting than some similar characters who just talk about getting stronger and then do so, (ie. Ichigo in Bleach), Jinwoo becomes a rather flat character and his internal struggles become muddled by the midway point. Yes, he is noble again in the end, but he becomes rather unbreakable and unrelatable. Moreover, his stakes are high but also pointless by the end of the story (no spoilers). Generally, the characters are unimportant, unrelatable, lack depth, and, as aforementioned, end up being irrelevant by the end of the manhwa, making the overall story less interesting. Enjoyment: 5/10 This story started off feeling unique, though it was rather repetitive near the beginning. I really wanted to like this manwha, and I was hopeful that the ending would have a captivating point, moral dilemma, or thought-provoking plot twist. Although it fell short and I found the plot and characters to be lacking, I thoroughly enjoyed the art. I believe the art is a perfect depiction of the world and perfectly encapsulates the video-game feel. It’s as if the artist were the story’s primary architect!

Over time people found it's holes and everyone agreed it was dog water. I believe Solo Leveling will be just like SAO, everyone loved it but when people stop and look at it, it really isn't as good as you first thought. You can't tell me with a straight face that this manga is just as good as anime/manga such as Bleach or One Piece. But people hold this manhwa on a pedestal they say ... it is leagues ahead of others. But nowadays manhwa have just as good art better pacing and even more compelling characters. Yes I like this series but I have reread this multiple times and read a lot others. I have found that this isn't as good as people say but it still has a place in my heart and probably always will. I just want to say that this isn't the perfect manhwa or should other manga/manhwa try to get to it's level. They should try new things just as SAO and SL did. Not only does it make a better story it makes a more memorable one."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Solo Leveling is essentially your typical power fantasy, with its only standout feature being the very good art, specially the coloring and the shading. The premise is simple, gates with different levels of danger appear around the world, requiring hunters to enter and eliminate the threats. The main character is Sung Jin-Woo, a hunter with an extremely low ranking that gains an ability that allows him to become stronger in an easy way (compared to other humans), that quickly becomes the strongest. Initially, the story seemed to have some potential, but quickly I noticed that I was wrong. The narrative follows a simple formula: the main character enters ... a gate, something unexpected happens, clears the gate with relative ease, becomes stronger and repeat. This makes it a tad repetitive and predictable, and as the main character kept stronger the lack of genuine challenges made it less engaging over time. Another significant issue lies in the abundance of plot conveniences. For example: Jin-Woo has a daily quest, and if uncompleted, he is transported to another area with a giant worm and has to survive for an hour. In one instance, during a life-threatening situation, the daily quest timer unexpectedly saved himby transporting him to another world. Also, as the daily quest penalty doesn't scale, during the time he was transported to the worm's world, it wasn't even a significant challenge. The story neglects characters aside from Sung Jin-Woo, giving them minimal screen time, what makes them uninteresting and unimportant. Now, one might assume that if Sung Jin Woo receives all the screen time, he must be an interesting character, right? Unfortunately, that's not the case. He stands out as one of the blandest characters I've ever encountered, experiencing almost no character development throughout the entire story. He lacks a charismatic personality and displays minimal emotions. He was just made to look and act edgy. The only character development he undergoes is the transition from a generic weak main character who can be brave to an edgy overpowered main character. The worldbuilding is almost nonexistent, contributing to a lack of depth in the narrative. While I didn't consider it anything special, I still enjoyed Solo Leveling a bit at the start. However, as the story progressed and the main character became stronger, my enjoyment waned. By the halfway point, the quality of the narrative took a significant downturn, making it almost unbearable in the latter part of the story. If you just want to see a strong, edgy character decimating his enemies, with no need of a good story or characters, there is a good chance you will like Solo Leveling. Otherwise, it might be a disappointing investment of your time. Side note: It says preliminary but the remaining chapters are side stories that released some time after the end of the story, and I finished SL before their release."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Solo leveling is a pretty good powerfantasy. Its story is good enough and the art is pretty. The setting of the story is a world where a group of people have magical abilities and use these abilities to fight monsters in gates that randomly appear throughout the world. The main character in the story is the only person whose magical abilities can grow stronger while the rest of the world is locked in at their own level. It's a pretty simple but pretty neat concept which can be fun to read. The story starts off strong and remains pretty interesting throughout the manga due to ... the ever increasing scale of the fights and groups of people. It is only at the end and and with the side-stories (which are chronologically after the main story) that the manga can become boring or confusing to read. The main character is by far the most important character and everything revolves around him. He isn't a great character but I guess it's good enough for the story. While the supporting characters aren't bad, it's not like they're great either and they are not given the chance to be. The artstyle is great and the entire manga looks good with some pretty impressive looking scenes throughout the manga. Overall this is certainly worth reading if you enjoy the powerfantasy genre. If you do not like this genre then you are very likely to not enjoy reading this."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Today, there are many anime and manga with main characters with game systematics. This manhwa is a work that has managed to set itself apart from the rest and has come to the fore quite well. The fact that our character was weak at first and we slowly followed the steps he took on the way to laugh was what made it really attractive. It can be annoying to see people who are always strong and have this power, or who take over their power without much trouble. But that changes when it comes to a combat situation. Its managed to attract me with action and ... impressive drawings. It's also interesting in a way that it modernizes a complex but impressive class like the Necromancer and handles its abilities and summoning in this way. Even if the ending of manwha didn't manage to satisfy me that much (finally making everything perfect by making a deal to get rid of everything happen) A good stepping stone to make a good start and familiarize yourself with the manga/manhwa culture.

The story may not be extremely original and one could find a lot of similarities to the isekai, but the main character is not OP as f**k from the start, so one follows his gradual development. The drawing and level of detail is perfect. It really is a feast for the eyes to watch the setting and characters. I really enjoyed the colors and drawing in the later stages of the manhwa. The side characters are unfortunately unmemorable. A bunch of them appear throughout, but ... I didn't form any emotional attachment to them. They don't get much room to express themselves or have any depth. But a couple of the Shadow Army characters were really cool (Beru for example).

The art is absolutely masterpiece (although the chin is too sharp, it may kill someone x.x) action scenes are great, though I feel it gets kinda 'repeated' so it gets a lil' boring reading it. This last few chapters, I feel they kinda drag it with the action scenes so it got boring LOL. But ... I still read it since it's almost over anyways Spoiler alert; I did not like how the author just put the strongest(?) female hunter as MC's girlfriend. She's attracted to him bcs of what? his scent? LMAO. What abt the MC? What makes him attracted to her? Also, there aren't any development between them, suddenly MC was like \"OH let's take her to JP to eat\"... WTF?

Yes and no. While I will admit that the art is truly amazing, and that many episodes will have you on the edge of your seat, there are also many issues with Solo Leveling. Firstly, the plot is one of the most generic I've seen. There are uncountable conveniences that are just there to push the story, create conflict, and sometimes just there to make Sung Jin Woo seem cool. For example (spoiler) Sung Jin Woo gains the ability of teleportation, ... however when his sister's school was being attacked, he decided to waste time to FLY there. We clearly see that he has a shadow soldier attached to his sisters shadow, but he somehow doesn't think to teleport there. Although we know that the teleportation has a cooldown, we do not see him use it. If the author wanted to create the nail biting fear of whether or not he could reach his sister, they could at least show that Sung Jin Woo had already used up his teleportation. Aside from this, there are also many other tropes like the missing dad, luck that the MC just happens to be the person to get some crazy powerup, sick mother, and many others. Now we come to my biggest problem with Solo Leveling, the characters and their lack of unique personality. Some characters are quite enjoyable but on average, all the characters feel like bland personality-less pieces of cardboard. Especially the main character, Sung Jin Woo, who I would describe as being like drywall. His character is so unbelievably bland that I find it astounding that he isn't just a walking talking piece of cardboard. His character can really be described with only a few words, protective dense badass. This trope of a character has been so overdone that it makes me want to throw up. His only goals are: \"become the strongest\" and \"protect family\", but aside from those goals, he has no personality. He exists to be a wishfufillment badass that kids can strive to be, and while there is nothing wrong with that, it doesn't make for the best narrative. But Sun Jin Woo is not the only bad character, the abundance of waifus that just pop in and get kicked out just as fast as they were introduced is mind-boggling. Every love interest just exists to give the audience that warm feeling inside, and give Sung Jin Woo someone to protect for an arc. The story isn't all terrible though, it was my and many others first manhwa and it serves as a perfect gateway for someone who wants to begin to experience the wonders that the eastern side of the world holds. It's art has yet to be replicated despite the hundreds that try to, and some episodes will truly make your heart race and long for more. Overall, Solo Leveling is considered by many to be the peak of comic media, and while I don't think it's perfect, I certainly see all of it's merits."}, {"score": "8", "content": "The truth is that if your looking for a dark power fantasy with amazing art and outstanding, (understatement) peak humanity levels of sheer fucking badassery then this is your read, 100%, but if your looking for deep meaningful read with amazing characters that's gonna make you wanna change your life then this isn't it at all, there's nothing meaningful in this show that really revolves with the plot, this is just, am feeling tired today lemme read something cool, hype and relaxing and there's nothing better than this out there, anything else and this manhua sucks, characters are mid, there's only character development for mc, ... world building is fine but nothing special and really there's nothing special about this manga, it's just hype and always feels great when your read, am gonna rate it 8 because it is really fun to read but it's not perfect or a life changing story, it's just pure fucking FUN If you read it already and want something like this then, omniscient reader and the boxer are my top pick to you , hardcore levelling warrior is good and rooftop swordsmaster are good too Have a fun read"}, {"score": "8", "content": "Solo leveling is a manhwa(Korean manga) made digitally. Full colour. It is based on a novel by author Chugong and drawn by Jang Sung-ark. It is the story of a guy called Sung Jin woo, just an average guy. Living in the world without his father, and with his ill mother. This guy has no special abilities, and works really hard to make ends meet. And.....I forgot to mention, this is a magical Earth! From time to time portals to dungeons open up and people enter them and fight demons. By defeating those demons/monsters they become powerful and gain gold, stones, weapons, runes, etc. Similar ... to a video game. Reading this manga felt like I’m “reading” a video game. Or watching a game stream on twitch/YouTube. This genre of manga/manhwa has become super popular in the last few years. People can now easily draw on their iPads and computers and can upload their stories online. What is the most quick gratifying story ever? The story that you dream about, your wildest dream, maybe when sleeping, or staring outside your window, or in the washroom or when taking a shower. Your wildest fantasy? A world where you are special. When you can be the most powerful and famous person around. The most interesting part of becoming this all powerful being is the growth from a nobody to the boss. This growth or change, this delta is the greatest source of joy for any gamer. This manga captures that sense of joy. That’s one point. The second thing that this manga does, is that it captures the joy of re-playing a game. After completing a game, when you go back to the tutorial levels, doesn’t it feel great? Nostalgic, happy, bittersweet and also it feels powerful. That’s the feeling you get when reading about the MC who powers through this game/manga. And damn, it is fun to read. Story. 7/10 The story is weak to be honest. It is not an original. The first manga of this kind to go viral was the Legendary Moonlight Sculptor. Recently there have been more, eg.Overgeared, The boxer(not fun, too monotonous for me). The theme of game, and overpowered MC. The problem with this plot is that it gets stale pretty soon. Seeing character growth is fun, seeing the MC use his new powers is fun. But only upto a point. And where does it end? Saving the world. Yup. Have seen that too many times. Not original. BUT...... solo leveling manages to execute this story really well. It may be generic, but it is the best generic in this genre. I enjoyed reading it. It is easy reading. Not much dialog, not much to think. Smooth art. Just enjoy. Don’t look at plot holes. Don’t think too much, just enjoy. If you can do that, you’ll have fun reading this story. Art. 8/0 I loved the art. This manga might not have become so famous in black and white. The character design, the manga, dungeons, monsters, dragons!! So cooool! Loved the fight scene, kept scrolling, a lot. No complains about art. Characters. 7/10 I believe a good story relies heavily on its characters. In this case it relied more heavily on the concept of leveling up as a gamer. The protagonist- Sung Jin woo is a good guy. I like how he is smart, hardworking and cares for his family. But at the same time, even after the manga is over I don’t feel a connect with him. I don’t really care for him or about him. He’s not Sung Jin woo to me, he is just the Mc of a manga. I don’t like that. He is often self centered, as someone with great power may become. Can’t blame him. But towards the end he made some weird decisions that I won’t say, to avoid spoiling stuff. I wish the mangaka had shown more of Jin woo’s personal side to us, his monologues, his thoughts behind his action. That might have added another dimension to this manga. Other characters are okay, they do their bit. But not very memorable. In the last half of the manga everyone was on the sidelines, we didn’t see much from anyone. The story made them insignificant. I liked the last chapter, ended on a sweet note, so I’ll forgive that. Overall. 8/10 I had fun reading this manga/manhwa and would recommend reading this to you. If you want a deep manga like Vagabond, Vinland Saga or a comedy like Ippo, GTO or a romance manga....look away. This manga doesn’t have that. If you want a light, fast read.....get instant gratification without thinking much about the story. And also have amazing art action sequences, you must read this. You’ll find many manga in this genre, but this is one of the best. It is not a great manhwa, but it is definitely a good manhwa. Worth reading."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Let me preface this by saying: my scoring is quite generous, where 7 is considered something decent and worthwhile. TL;DR -art (10): absolutely marvelous -characters (6): alright characters, but not particularly deep -story (7): pretty good, but doesn't seem to have a direction -enjoyment (8): would recommend -overall (8): definitely not perfect, but still good Many people have said that Solo Leveling is not the average fantasy with an OP MC, but story-wise, I'm going to have to disagree. That being said, it's still a good read, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action and fantasy comics. What Solo Leveling has going for it is ridiculously good art ... and likable characters. To put it simply, the art is fantastic; not only is the actual art gorgeous, but the panel composition and layout also draws the reader in. The characters are likable, but as of now, the only character we extensively know about is Sung Jin-Woo, the overpowered protagonist. Of course, it's fun to see the underdog slay monsters and level up, but Sung Jin-Woo doesn't seem to have an end goal for all the stuff he's doing, making him a somewhat flat character. He is surrounded by members of the supporting cast, which we know basically nothing about since this is \"Solo Leveling,\" focusing only on Sung Jin-Woo thus far, but based on the information given, they're fairly interesting and likable. The main problem I personally have with Solo Leveling is the story, which at time of writing (Ch 106; end of Jeju Island Arc), doesn't seem to have a direction. So far it's only a decent \"zero-to-hero\" story despite what many fans proclaim. Sung Jin-Woo tirelessly fights monsters to level up, but what for? Even if grows without direction, I still enjoy it, but I can't help but feel that there is so much more potential to the story that goes unexplored. I have heard from light novel readers that the plot starts progressing and getting better with the latest arc, but being a manhwa only reader, I unfortunately cannot confirm that statement. In the end, Solo Leveling is definitely a fun read, but I worry that if you come in expecting a nigh perfect comic that reinvents the action fantasy genre, you'll be a little disappointed.

Overall action is good and world building is decent, however character design is dumpster tier, so don't really get attached to characters since every ... single one but the MC is completely irrelevant and the story would work the exact same way without em. Also the character development is pretty much only reserved to the protagonist, which isn't bad per se, especially considering the title of the Manhwa but still makes it pretty dull.

These new chapters try and give closure to some of those things which is a positive, but all in all I don't feel they added much. Imagine your regular 13 ep anime season which finishes well with the last episode, then has some beach OVA which is completely voluntary to watch. This feels more like the last episode ended almost ... as intended but left some stuff out due to screen time limitations, so they release an episode 14 which is half a slice of life closure episode, and half trying to reboot the excitement of the original series within one erratic episode for some dumb reason. The series not knowing how to properly wrap up it's ending and whether to have a serious sequel story or not is why I've dropped this to a 9 for me. Even if you argue the last chapters are supposed to be a comedic extra release, it's released as the main story's chapters and contains canonic endings - so it's voluntary but not really.

But they suddenly become nothing but flukes and ants when compared to Jinwoo and their whole character gets downplayed so hard that it makes you think if they were really even that strong in the first place. As for the whole ant arc, it was really reminiscent of hunter x hunter. But with hxh, there was depth, development, an actual story that gets you feeling a rollercoaster of emotions, whereas with solo leveling, they just kill off a bunch of hunters, jinwoo swoops in, saves the day and that's that. Another thing is that they bring up his father who went missing, which also happens to ging in hxh, but they never gave us really any background on his dad or flashback to add some more dimension in the story. They just kind of make him seem as a tough guy who inherited the fragment of brilliant light and then he proceeds to die shortly after making a bigger reveal around chapters 160+. It doesn't amount to much. Overall, I think some will enjoy it, some won't. There's not enough \"flavor\", it's more simple and straight to the point. I wish they expanded on certain stories a while longer, the beginning was really good in its own respective way. I liked the idea that Jinwoo was this weakling who amounted to nothing, and was the only one who decided to stay back in the temple to save everyone knowing that he is the weakest. If they were able to develop his character in a less op way and added more backstory it'd be a lot better because it just felt like they tried to do that in the very beginning with him being the weakest --> gets determined to being the strongest but then never lifts off of that and ends up just making him op every single chapter."}, {"score": "6", "content": "I'll keep this review short Story: 4/10 The story was interesting at first but slowly became boring and bland.

Felt like they had another 50+ chapters set but had to squeeze it into 5 for some ... reason. The more I think about the story itself after finishing the more I have mixed feelings about it. Several things not paid off well or at all & so many characters that didn't matter at all. Very few side characters get any real \"screentime\" and none of them really developed. Almost every one of them could be removed from the story with little to no impact. Several of them seem like they will be important later but then just never show again except as a cameo kind of thing. Some things in the story were built up for a while with no payoff at all, rushed past it so much I have to wonder why it was built up Romance certainly isn't built up well in this series MC himself develops early on, but gets pretty stagnant and isn't a really interesting character wise.

It would have been great to see more one-on-one fights between the Monarchs and the national level hunters, with Jin-Woo taking on the final villain.

How we see Jinwoo progress from a Rank E to a Rank OVER-Nation was Fantastic. From how he help his family, see some that was disrespectful but some that still support him was rare, most of the time, everyone just complain and the MC try to stand up, but here it was more 30/70 so 30% was insulting but a good 70% was supportive. Sadly when i say that it was almost perfect.. we have to ... talk about the END.. it was definitly the WORSE !!! The real end of the webtoon is at chapter 177. Restart the world was the worse decision, just because some have died, okay so indeed it has create a world where monsters doesn't really exist, but i wanted so much to see people pay even more respect to Jin woo for save the world.. also during this \"redemption\" when the father asked what Jinwoo choosed, he asked to erase all memory about him as a Hunter, i mean i've understand because he said that he doesn't want to act like he doesn't know, but what i wanted was the father to HUG his son, thanks him, tell him that he's proud of him and then say that he would go to erase his memory for live a normal life.. but NO ! Didn't happens ! then from nowhere Jinwoo has a son.. that can use magic and things.. we told me \"'don't worry, the part with his son is NEAT !!\" WTH ?! it was so god damn awful ! He just has been carried by his father and done nothing and succeed everything.. ive just quit when i saw him smiling like \"ha ha, i'm so good\" he was just cringe for me.. Anyway I know that most of the reason of why it end up bad was because of the Death of the author.. but they've could helped for create something better.. and also when ive quit because of the cringe kid, i've came back, bc remember that Beru was building a Statue of his master with him holding his baby.. so i've came back and didn't read, just skip throught to see reaction of Jinwoo.. until i saw that he didn't react to it ! NOTHING HAPPENED ! And then he go again, say goodbye to his wife and then END ?!.. So yeah.. if it would end at chapter 177 it would be a 9/10 (almost 10, bc tons of characters was shown has strong guy, but couldn't see their power, or the sister that wasn't caring much about his brother while he helped for pay her school) but beside that it was really perfect and jinwoo was a cool characters that i've really liked !"}, {"score": "7", "content": "The Hype about this manhwa was big, i thought this would be one of the best storys but i was disappointed after reading it. I read it 2 times because i got mixed feelings after the first time and wanted to know what was responsible for it. -Story The story is really good the topic of the weakest becoming the strongest is worn out but Solo Leveling has made out of this topic a unique story which i really like. The pacing is horrible the most time everybody wants to make the story longer but this time they just skipped the most and rushed the ending. Sung Ji-Woo is just ... to fast leveling up its just one rank after another the story is to much focused on making the MC stronger and fights.There is not really a story between fights.Its just disappointing that they made him that fast too strong its kinda boring then they could easily pace it slower and make it more interesting and longer. Till chapter 40 the pacing was okay after afterwards everything seemed rushed. There is not really a heart behind that story. No relationships no comrades not really backstories. It feels empty and filled with only fights. The end of the whole story is not my type, completely rushed and they skipped everything and just said he was 27 years there fighting and won. The plot with going back in time and destroying everything surprised me but it just didnt feel good like the end lacks something. -Characters There is not really a big aim for characters in this story its just about our MC. I feel like the world in solo leveling is empty. There are many interesting characters but none of them got much attention. Especially his sister her brother is completely different and there are not that much conversations between them. He risked his life as an hunter to pay for his sisters tuition but when he got enough money doesn't interact with her that much. Then Cha Hae-In our MCs future wife in the story he interacted with her just a few times never showed that much interest but fell in love. Like what? We dont really got much information about her which is kinda strange when shes the MCs girl? Lee-Joohee appeared some times but in the beginning it looked like she and our MC knew themselves for a long time. She had a crush on him for sure and he liked her also they would go out to eat together if the double dungeon didnt appear. So its also kinda strange that she retired being a hunter and left Sung Ji-Woo without any big conversations they didnt even go out to eat even after it was a promise.Our MC rescued her in the accident and didn't meet her after surviving? He promised to visit her in busan but also never done it. the relationships are just strange in this story. -Drawing Cant say anything bad about the drawings its just great the style is on an different level.

Have a good reading."}, {"score": "7", "content": "Solo Levelling is very popular, and it is immediately apparent why. It has style, attractive characters, and captures current preferences for isekai-flavour. So while it has all the makings of a main-stream starlet, I personally find it to be lacking in imagination, depth and vision. Each individual arc has been rather formulaic. We have seen it all before. The MC gets into some sticky situation, and he either immediately over powers it, or gets knocked around a bit before he inevitably crushes. These fights aren't very detail orientated and strategy is a minor concern. What strategy and considerations are relevant to other characters (specific class ... strengths etc) are completely irrelevant to the MC. The big bad ant was outclassed on everything it tried - that may be \"cool\", but it isn't very interesting. My primary concern is that due to the very nature of power within this series (e.g. your rank is fixed and there is little that can be done to mitigate that), we are going to reach a situation where other characters are simply part of the background. Like One Punch Man but without it being a gag. There is some suggestion in the recent chapters that power levels might be changing with the advent of more gates opening up, so maybe my concern will be ameliorated, but somehow I doubt that it will (especially given the spoilers I've seen in regards to the \"barrier expert\" in the next arc). So, if the main thrust of the series, the action, isn't very interesting. What about characters? Setting? I've already touched on the setting not being very well elucidated. The geopolitical situation is touched on slightly, but the officials seem to have a very intense blindness when it comes to the MC and how they can possibly utilise him. For example, why did they allow him to just reject joining the Jeju Island Raid without any attempt to draw a deal with him? Given the history of prior excursions onto the island they should have been on high alert and been involving anyone they possibly could who might make a difference. But they don't even try to simply offer money to the MC? Why?? Other possible elements of the setting such as what has been the economic and technological implications of the gates and the awakenings are left impoverished. Hunters from other countries don't seem any different than those native to South Korea and we have next to no sense of what the relative situations of each country is when it comes down to gates. The number of S-tier hunters is commented on but everything else is left in the dark. Characters on the other hand, while not awful, are far from memorable. Many of them don't get enough screen time and don't have enough plot relevance for us to even develop much of an interest in them. Some of the S-tier hunters have moments to demonstrate their competencies, but this usually falls by the wayside when it comes time for the MC to have another moment in the sun. I also take particular issue with the development of the MC, who appears to change drastically as soon as he re-awakens. I know his trauma and prior situation is used to justify this, but I just find it rather hard to believe. He also has a metamorphosis from goofy-weak looking kid to a jacked k-pop idol with little justification apart from the \"system did it\". It thought it would may be associated with his attributes, but despite him gaining about 200 points in every one since then he hasn't undergone any other drastic physical change (which is why I sort of hate the addition of attributes in these stories, even if they are common in RPGs). I also would have liked some commentary on the blatant inhumanity of the MC in certain situations. Specifically, brutally murdering a large number of demon clans when climbing the tower. He forms an alliance with the first one he meets after having some affinity for the clumsy girl underneath the demon mask, and then her father is also shown to be rather human in his emotional profile. Are we meant to believe that the other clans are not the same? If so, if you liked those two characters shouldn't you also feel that all those clans being eviscerated is somewhat morally questionable? It would have been interesting to see the MC realise that he was beginning to view sentient entities as simply bags of XP and loot, rather than as characters with personalities and aspirations. Of course, Solo Levelling makes the majority of its antagonistic monsters, even the intelligent ones, to be completely morally reprehensible (with creepy grins to match). \"I am the Sorcerer King\" tackles this in a far more interesting way but setting up intelligent adversaries who aren't necessarily immediately blood thirsty and are simply having to contend with the situation they find themselves in as well. The situation in Solo Levelling is fine, but I just don't find it as interesting. In conclusion, is Solo Levelling enjoyable? Yes. But it most certainly does not approximate a masterpiece, and there are series with very similar starting premises that are far more elaborate and creative in how they have moved forward in their setting, characters and concepts (such as \"I am the Sorcerer King\")."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Great Art, Fair Story with the potential to have been fantastic. Solo Leveling lures you in with great paneling and amazing quality to read, with each panel perfectly flowing the scenes cohesively and consistently. The art is consistent with amazing quality for the output of the work the artist brings. The biggest downfall which cripples much of the potential is also the same reason why the webtoon is so popular... Power fantasy. I have read the light novel and am currently up to date with the webtoon. The amount of \"(character here) jaw drops to the floor\" \"(character here) eyes widened\" as the MC runs around ridiculously overpowering ... anything and everything like a blatant placeholder for the reader and their power fantasy is almost exhausting. This is combined with constant showering of compliments, women, respect, and fame from paparazzi while the MC acts all cool and uncaring of his popularity, the extreme edgyness of MC vs the world if his family is in trouble, almost like if Vin Diesel was an overpowered god that can destroy a tank with a side swipe of his muscle car. All of this, of course, is typical of any power fantasy story, which in my opinion, is extremelly cringe as I have had that phase of my middle school of imagining such stories to escape my horrible experience. The biggest issue, is that this power fantasy and the almost obsessiveness to put Jin Woo (MC) in this massive pedastall of perfectness and coolness completely takes away from the MASSIVE potential of more world building and character development. We have a large host of some of the most interesting characters, yet all they boil down to is to make the MC look good. \"Oh the MC is so cool, so he must have this powerful woman who becomes so submissive to him, who cares if there are 2 or 3 women who are love interests that we just completely leave out of the story?\". Many other males in this are made so arrogant just so the MC can humiliate them, but of course, Jin Woo won't kill them most of the time, so they gotta die horrible deaths by other means. There is also clearly some tension included in this, specifically with Japan, Japan in this story just gets completely screwed over and humiliated, almost as if the author of the story has some genuine disdain over them. Overall majority of the characters who are not Korean is pretty much made to look like assholes, while Koreans are the underdog, the poor and innocent who are now at the top of the world thanks to the MC. Once again I cannot stress enough how much the power fantasy takes away from the story and world, and when I mean world building and story, I mean the characters that enrich this world (an example is the characters from OPM, such as the S class). Instead of witnessing the unique variety of powers, skills, and the massive powers of Nation level hunters, we get Jin Woo, over and over again, the same abilities just used in different ways which is almost repetitive. Overall, if you are into power fantasy, or are interested in things such as dragon ball where the MC is somewhat a placeholder for yourself, this is definately for you. I am not saying it's necessarily a bad thing, just not really for me. I do enjoy the light novel an webtoon which despite my criticisms I will still recommend giving it a read, but I cannot ignore the wasted potential of the amazing world and the uniqueness and freshness it brought to the MMO/Game IRL, whatever you want to call it genre."}, {"score": "6", "content": "So I read it too and would like to add my two cents. \"Solo Leveling\" was/is a trendsetter that inspired an entire generation of manhwa, manga and probably anime and created a \"genre\" that has the potential to replace isekai. As such, the manhwa is well worth a look, much like \"Sword Art Online\" is worth a look because it shaped the isekai genre. But that doesn't make either SAO or \"Solo Leveling\" good series. Fueled by innovative ideas, they once inspired thousands, but when you look back now after seeing other stories based on these ideas, you realize that the trendsetters can hardly compete. Because ... the concepts have been chewed over so many times by now, they seem generic, because so many other works have copied the ideas but put their own spin on them, \"Solo Leveling\" is boring. Nevertheless, the manhwa definitely has a certain charm that can entertain for just under the first 100 chapters. Sure - there are many missed opportunities, but it's fun to read. Accordingly, I was really shocked when the manhwa made a U-turn from chapter 100 and started to bombard the reader with battles. While enemies had previously been hyped for dozens of chapters, we now encounter one oh-so-strong opponent after another. On top of that, Solo Leveling presents a \"story\" that really frustrated me. It is very shallow and can be summarized in two sentences, but is revealed over an extremely long period of time and is often rather confusing. For example, some of the factions from this story have almost identical names (\"Ruler\" and \"Monarch\" - wow, two times ruler, I can tell that apart). This culminates in another twist in the finale and results in one of the worst endings I've ever seen. However, the author himself seems to be aware that he has fucked up the finale or he has listened to the criticism of the fans, because it is followed by an epilogue of almost 30 chapters, which is by far the best part of the entire manhwa. For example, many of the previously mentioned missed opportunities are taken up. Conclusion: Chapters 1-100 are well worth reading, chapters 100-170 are almost unbearable and I could have read 300 chapters of chapters 170-200."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Solo leveling is the average guilty pleasure crappy manwha, It is evident without a doubt that SL is purely a self insert 12-year-olds will love this OP cool character edgy type manwha.

Story: What story? The premise is fascinating but there is nothing to it the underlying mysteries and intricacies of the manwha are both complicated and generic at the same time - certain aspects had so much potential ... and if it wasn't for terrible writing this could've been a masterpiece. The willingness to explore the world and discuss guilds and hunters from all over the world could've been fun and even the premise of OP S class compared to weak E class could have added to this concept yet time and time again the basic and boring writing which tailored to an audience who in reality only really wanted a feel-good OP MC generic manwha. Characters: Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is perhaps the worst bunch of characters in literature of a certain quality. This is not of a hyperbolic tone for I say this in complete sincerity that every single character is quasi-appalling. To commence the MC has nothing about him he's just there to be oh-so-cool and oh-so edgy I can't describe to you what he's like - a child can make a more interesting protagonist his motivations are non-existent (like his personality) he isn't egotistical nor humble he's nothing there is nothing that draws you into JinWoo. HOWEVER, He somehow is not the worst character - every single side character is meaningless none of them do anything or even mean anything they are all beyond boring and useless the power ranking system becomes a dud every character appears weak even the national hunters just end up being quite pathetic - every time you gain interest upon these characters you lose it just as fast because the manwha cannot and just seems to refuse the idea of developing its characters By like chapter 50 he's already OP and somehow the strongest person in the world its so futile they cannot be developed because to Jin Woo all they'll ever be is a mere burden. Throughout my reading of the manga it became so frustrating to see a potentially interesting character just become completely useless as Jin Woo is too OP and all the creatures are just much too strong even his own family means nothing his flashbacks are so redundant it's a literal joke at this point the creator gave him a family to pursue any sense of depth and its meaningless because you can't find yourself caring any bit about them because you know nothing about them. Art: The one thing I can simply say is that the art was magnificent. the panels were always vibrant and filled with colour and its nice to be able to see what goes on in fight scenes .

The anime was hyped for years and during that wait there was certainly a lack of new action anime that was good. As the release date of the anime approached I heard people mention that it was a \"typical power up\" manwha that doesn't break any new ground. However, I still remained hopeful that it would be good. After I saw the first episode, I got impatient and decided to read the manwha. I read up to chapter 59. There are THREE big problems. 1. The Lack of Excitement A ... big problem that I noticed very quickly is that the chapters felt very repetitive and the battle strategy usually remained the same, regardless of the obstacle. Not only was the strategy largely the same, but nothing in the abilities seemed that interesting. It felt like I read dozens of chapters that played out the exact same way. I no longer cared if the MC gained a new level because nothing interesting came of it. 2. Motivation The second big problem that ran concurrent with the first big problem is that in the first chapter it suggests that the MC's reasoning to become a hunter was to financially support his mother's medical situation. That's a noble cause. However, I found it very strange that not one time after the first chapter up to chapter 59 was his mother, or her condition, ever mentioned again.... not by the MC or by anyone else. In fact, once you reach the chapters in the 20's you might even forget that she is supposed to be the big reason why the MC is continuing to be a hunter, because he now has a one track mind of getting stronger.................less so of getting money...and much less so for the reason why he wants money. He does come to a point that he makes a lot of money but you never see him use it in the way that you would expect him to. 3. Lack of Character Development and Cast After reading 59 chapters, I still barely know anything about the MC. The development of the MC to go from a weakling to being strong is handled in such a flippant way that I'm not surprised that the development from a meek/humble kid to a chad was completely instantaneous and without effort to explain it. Let's be honest here, we've seen plenty of anime/manga where a scrub gets overpowered.....but his personality towards his friends and non-enemies stays the same. It's unexplainable how the MC does a 180 flip in this regard. Frankly, it's insulting to the reader to just swallow that lazy writing. Beyond these things, it doesn't even seem that the MC has a life outside of hunting or has any friends. I will go so far as to say that he doesn't even have a life. He has absolutely nothing going for him. This is not done for the sake of creating a \"pity character who tried, but is alone\". No, this was just laziness of character creation and development. I've said it for years that a great anime/manga should focus on it's surrounding cast.....don't ignore it. This is exactly what Solo Leveling does. It ignores it. The MC's sister is largely forgotten, the girl teammate has been cast aside, the guy who wants him to finish 19 dungeons is barely shown, etc. I spoke on the MC's mother and sister....but you might wonder where his father is. Is the father dead? Left the family? Working all the time? Who knows....because in 59 chapters it doesn't once reference him. You think there would be a mention of the father in some regard if the MC is supposed to be helping out with the household bills and his mother's medical care. _________________________________- In Summary I can see what this manwha is striving to be, but unfortunately the people that told me to expect it to be \"meh\" before I started reading were correct. I do believe this series gets a lot of good reviews not because of substance, but because there is an influence of hype. When even \"Arifureta\" does this niche better? You've got a serious problem on your hands. The manga does make a minor improvement in the chapters in the 50's and maybe things will improve.....However, I've given it plenty of time to pull me in and it's lost the opportunity to do so now."}]}

Afterall it's another spokon story si will not make the diference, but is not that bad by the way. Art: 8 Nothing that makes the diference... So why did you put an 8? Well, you just have to read it and then you will see why, the autor transmits all the feeling in the careers and are actually (even nowing who will won or lose the caree) excting as fuck. Probably it's not the best artwork you will see on a manhwa because the background stage of some pages are not the best, but you'll definetly like how is made the artwork in general. Character: 9 This is strange and a little bit bizard but let's start, first of all i have to say that the characters design and personality are so poor... but then Vinny makes his appear and becomes an special character that you will probably never forget. Enjoyment: 10 Ciclism is actually one of my favourite sports like basketball so I really enjoy it as fuck. If you like spokons suchs as Haikyuu!, Kuroko no basuke or Yowamushi Pedal, you will probably, love as much as i love Wind Breaker. Overall: 9 I think it will never deserve a 10 but considering how the history is going and how is improving the autor with the time i really want to support it and read one chapter every week, enjoying every single line and every single drawing of it. I know this is short, i know this is porbably a bad review, but i am just impresed about this manhwa, so i actually just realised that i can coment here to recomendate to anyone because, and afterall, Wind Breaker it's actually a GOOD manwha. Thanks."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Fucking Discontinued… 😭 But Wind Breaker is without a doubt my favorite sports manga/manhwa. Easy 10/10. I’m not gonna go super deep into the plot so people can experience it for themselves, but just know the story is fantastic. It has every emotion. There are heartbreaking moments, goofy and fun ones, and some seriously top-tier character development. Jay Jo is an amazing main character. He starts off quiet and keeps to himself, but he’s insanely talented and adapts to everything that comes his way. His relationship with his uncle was honestly one of my favorite parts, it’s so nice compared to his family situation, and you ... can really tell how much he loved his uncle. Vinny’s still my favorite though. He’s got an amazing backstory and so much fight, and he doesn’t mess around. Wind Breaker also nails the side characters and antagonists. Whether I love them or hate them (sometimes both), they’re all so well-written. Kaneshiro Takeda, Owen Knight, Noah Austin, Hyuk “Grim Reaper” Kwon, Sangho Choi, there are so many I could name. The art also gets insanely good as the seasons go on. And as someone who's super into cycling, the way they capture speed, motion, and intensity is just awesome. I’ve got so much passion for this series, it’s more than just a sports story, it’s something that really sticks with you."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Wind Breaker is a damn passionate take on cycling and friendship. The plot of Wind Breaker follows a highschooler and avid cyclist named Jay. Throughout the series Jay makes friends and encounters some crazy situations, all thanks to his passion for cycling. I don't want to spoil anything that actually goes down in the story, this is a general rundown of the starting premise for Wind Breaker. Something that should also be mentioned is that the series features a lot of humor. In fact, the hilarious humor of Wind Breaker allows the plot time to pace itself, resulting in a series that feels relevant and ... fresh consistently. I'll talk more about the kind of humor featured in the series later. Art plays a surprisingly relevant role in Wind Breaker, especially in keeping the 'feel' of the series fresh and trendy. I'd argue that this is in large thanks due to the character designs. Characters in Wind Breaker simply look different from each other, serving to give them each a sense of individuality, whether in the form of hair style or clothing, it is certainly effective. With this said, characters don't just look different for the sake of looking different, their appearance gives an indication on who they are, breathing life into characters in a way that isn't over the top nor unnoticeable. The fashion in Wind Breaker is also generally appealing, quite a rare thing to see in this medium. The characters.. are awesome! Seriously, the characters just about make this series what it is. Perhaps my favorite aspect about the characters are that they're so realistic, yet they're not a generic cut-out. Too often in the medium do we get a character that is ONLY a personality trait, I feel like this is especially true in sports series, thankfully this isn't the case in Wind Breaker. Equally awesome as the characters individually are the characters together, they've got the kind of relationship going on that is the envy of all high schoolers. Wind Breaker has a lot of different characters to like for different reasons, and I think that's one of it's crowning achievements. Am I enjoying Wind Breaker? (At the time of writing this review it's ongoing) heck yeah I am, and i'm sure that you will to. This series is a bunch of fun, even at its most serious.

I gave an 8 cuz 1. i pissed about some author decisions towards the characters (LOL) 2. it's still ongoing But overall, you should give it a try because you will enjoy it tons. It does has romance, bromance and drama but it's not that annoying, it feels normal (in case you worry)"}, {"score": "9", "content": "As someone who isn't really a big fan of Korean manhwas or webtoons I was really surprised by how much I actually enjoyed reading through this. I'd say it's a crime so many people don't give this a chance, I really feel like this deserves even more popularity. STORY 8/10 - Seeing that this is a sports/cycling manga at the end of the day you can't exactly expect it to have some outstanding story, but, for what it's worth I do think the story and the overall plot is handled well enough, the premise of the story is also interesting. Safe to say I did not ... expect this to revolve all in just one single tournament. (So far that is). The drama part, well keeps the plot going on, the comedy in it is fairly well handled, most of the jokes and funny moments do land and occasionally make me chuckle and it isn't really overdone or anything like that. ART 9/10 - During the beginning of the story, for at least 20-40 chapters the art was really just okay, it wasn't that good if I'm being honest, it wasn't terrible or anything. But man, does the Art improve SO much throughout the story, it really gets so much more beautiful later on that there is probably panels that are wallpaper worthy which are amazingly well done. The art might have been a little weak at the beginning but it sure gets outstandingly great later on. CHARACTERS 9/10 - Now the characters in this story might be a little controversial. First we have Jay, the protagonist of the story, I've seen there is a few people who dislike him and say that he is a pretty weak overall character. Jay is super smart, he has top grades in school and has one especially strict mom, and he also loves cycling. As the story goes on he'll have to make choices and decide what he really wants to do in life, and he really doesn't want to end up regretting the decisions he makes in the present, which is understandable since regret is a scary thing, you can see that he changes a lot, he goes from being someone who pretty much isolates himself from everyone else, doesn't really care to make friends and only focuses on his studies. But after going through several challenges he pretty much changed all that and develops into a new person, he finds people who he likes, he finds something he wants to focus on, which is cycling. I think chapters like the one where he says that the last thing he would do if he only had one week to live would be cycling with his friends. I don't think the Jay at the beginning of the story would say something like that. So I do think that Jay is an overall solid protagonist. . Vinny is probably one character which is probably way more well done than even Jay, he gets introduced as your usual generic bully evil guy who'll probably get beaten up soon and never show up in the story again, but he's not anywhere near to that, he's much more different. He has had to live an awfully tough life since the beginning of his childhood. The world and everyone around his has pretty much been unfair. He does handle some of these things poorly and doesn't necessarily make the best decisions. It's fascinating to see how much of a long way Vinny has made, he's been accepted into a group of friends, his attitude has changed so much for the better, he's giving his best effort to win the tournament for his mom, he's even developed a love interest. Seeing him going through countless hardships one by one to the point where he is now is one of my favorite parts of this story. . You also got Minu and Dom, who both initially were Jay's first friends. Both of them have also had their fair share of their own troubles, Dom's motivation and mentality to always go on and train more and more is to a certain degree inspiring. Minu is one of the few characters on the story which gets into a whole lot of drama. Not to spoil anything but he sure is important to the overall story. ENJOYMENT 10/10 - Judging from my own pure subjective enjoyment on the story I can say I simply loved this, I really did enjoy it a lot. I usually hate most Korean manhwas or webtoons which a whole lot of times are just really repetitive or generic. This did not feel like that. I'm glad it got my interest and I checked it out. OVERALL 9/10 - It's not perfect, but it's certainly pretty great. It does have it's flaws, that's for sure. But I'd still say it's definitely worth checking out. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested on the sports genre, or cycling, really. I'm surprised it isn't relatively a bit more popular."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Embark on a heart-pounding journey with \"Wind Breaker,\" a webtoon that races through the exhilarating world of competitive cycling.

But, after more than 350 chapters in, it went downhill. The developmet of the characters and story is painfully slow, they have been in the same tournament all throughout the manhwa, Jay starts off being the cool quiet kid, but after that, he just becomes a spectator, no emotions, he beraly even speaks, you never know what he's thinking, there's just shots of him looking at something, without saying anything and ... that's it, I think overall it's an enjoyable read if you don't mind reading equivalent of 9 years of chapters, to characters be the same at the end of it, most of the characters have their own sideplots, but never actually change anything on their personalities, so it's basically filler, only character that actually had any development was Mia. This could've went really well if they focused on what's really important, it gets to the point where the tournament is just a background thing, it's just in the sidelines while the characters have all the atention, it's basically the tournament being only 5% of the show, and the other 95% is just drama and pointless side plots, there's just so many chapters where nothing happening is actually relevant to the story, and because there's so many characters, the author tries to focus on every one of them, telling their stories and relationships, wich in my opinion is very unecessary, i was enjoying up until 300 chapters when i realised that basically nothing happend.

Before diving into it, I had heard some buzz, but it wasn’t overwhelmingly hyped. Now that I’ve read it, I understand its excellence and why it deserves more recognition. Initially, I assumed it was a typical sports manhwa focusing on school cycling tournaments, but I was pleasantly surprised by its depth. While it centers on cycling, it intricately weaves intense drama and a cleverly written plot, making it much more than a conventional sports story. Admittedly, the artwork starts off subpar, but it undergoes a remarkable transformation, evolving into peak art as the series ... progresses. The dramatic storyline, involving richly developed characters, is captivating and highly relatable. There were moments that struck a chord with me due to their uncanny resemblance to real-life situations, making the emotional impact profound. Character development is a standout feature of \"Windbreaker.\" Each character is crafted with such detail and evolves with every season, enhancing the overall narrative. Although there are minor instances where the story diverges from the main plotline and the pace slightly falters, these moments are few and far between. The depth and complexity of the characters are extraordinary, and I found myself deeply invested in their journeys. I highly recommend this manhwa to everyone.

THE PLOT The story starts mundane with a common plot that the mc(jay) a studious introvert 2nd year high school student who has been constantly told by his mom that studying is everything and you can do whatever you want after you go to a good university but our mc loves cycling he is happiest when we ride A bicycle he has some excellent drifting skills without using brakes. His life began to change when a certain set of events led to met him menu(other kid at his same class) who offers him to ... create their own bycycle crew.(As a reader it will (to a extent) lead you to introspect that should you really do something that you love or something that is ahead of you) 2.CHARACTERS Now this is the strongest point of this manhwa it just don't focus solely on growth of mc( he may annoy you sometime btw) infact you will see that it has literally fair distribution of panels for each important side characters their growth along the journey has been represented beautifully They are likable and probably you will love them too. 3.The Art style It's only keep improving so no complain on that. 4.The story pacing Its kinda slow but I enjoy it. 5.it has also some hilarious one piece and Naruto jokes. If you love sports anime oh sorry manga/manhwa you should definitely gave it a try.( Delinquent fighting is icing on the cake for some)ITS A GEM HIDDEN IN THE MINE it's underrated now but if they ever make a proper anime adaptation I can guaranty you that will surpass most of the sports anime.

I felt like they're just dragging it at this point. It's the same story with every race. MC clutches the race, or MC gets destroyed and has a life lesson taught to him.

Obviously, what do you anticipate from the creator of viral hit and lookism.

Now here's the thing, the art in season 1 is very mid, it isn't special and all that shit, however as ... you continue to read the art will drastically improved; to the point I'd say it's comparable to Solo Leveling, at least character-art wise. I personally think, as you continue to read you wouldn't notice that the art is improving because of the plot and drama. I can't describe how I enjoyed this series, truly one of a kind, and is one of my favorite webtoons."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I will start by saying I am quite the sleeper, I know it is random however it helps me make the point that not many things can keep me going without sleep for 2 days. And Wind Breaker is one of them because I was emersed in a world full of... well drama, struggle and exaggerated scenarios. The 2 days that I spent reading this, addictive to a point of danger-story felt like more, felt like I was with these characters journeying through a world of regret and shame, a world where passion is the only thing that kept people going. Riding a bike is one ... of the most common things a person has at least once tried to do, an experience so miniscule in the scale of importance or that is what people think. I like to see it in a different way, I think it is one of the first times that a child can be let go of the parents, a slow and tricky challenge, where the child starts off their journey with the help of their parents, so they can ride without being wary of the balance. With the time and effort they will have to learn to balance themselves, and in a single seemingly unimportant moment the parent lets go of the bike and sets the child free to finally ride on its own, Cycling as a sport, on the other hand is a complete 180 of the casual bike ride. It is dangerous and risky, a sane person would not even think about trying to achieve something like riding a marathon on a bike. A normal person would throw up and give up. The few chosen ones with both the physique, mentality and most important: talent and grit, those are the few who can excel in this borderline crazy sport. Enough with the prologue about cycling though because in this manhwa we wont see the 99.9% we will be seeing the people who have what it takes. But before going about that we will have to go through a lot more. You see one thing that I, at first, did not appreciate about this manhwa was the lack of cycling, I mean that is the whole point of it right? Well... no, it took time to realize this is not a story about cycling it was about the experience of cycling stuck with drama, romance, comedy, slice of life and action. I was also frustrated for the better part of the first 250 chapters, due to one more reason, the missing main character. I was literally angry at some point, begging to the universe to add more DIALOGUE of the main character, not even scenes because he was shown in the story but he did not even talk, like man come on. Despite that, I decided to give up on the main character and looked for other characters in the story and that is when it hit me. It is because that the main character is silent for the better half of the manhwa that other characters can shine, and with those characters the MC can have the development that he had. From that moment I appreciated the long journey for the MC to find his voice. The characters are the stars of this manhwa, they have such dynamic personalities and a well-executed backstory. I mean even side characters got a lot of scenes and expressed their opinions. There were characters for everything, one to be hyped about, one to be a little more dramatic and depressing, one to be a comedic relief or one to hate and then love. Their interpersonal relationships were a mess and really infuriated me at some point but that is a price to pay. One thing I would like to point out is this manhwa is the first work of the author so there were some inaccuracies in terms of some details. But, that also means that you can see the author getting better with the cliffhangers and the story in general. And the best out of those improvements is... THE ART. Like damn, the art is getting better with every chapter and it gets to a point where it surpasses the 95% of manhwa art, arguably better than Solo Leveling's. And the DRIP, the drip is impeccable, you will see. The story is not that special but it has some charm to it, like the main character trying to decide what to do with his life, whether to live his parents dream of becoming a doctor and studying like a machine without human interaction, or live a life of his own accord, with the bicycle that his late uncle gave him. With added sub-plot filled with mystery and drama. Now lets talk a bit of the mysterious uncle, it is not a spoiler btw, he was a world-class and world-famous cyclist, a genius amongst geniuses, the top of the cycling world. A charming and happy personality, until it all came crushing down with a doping test that came out positive. A fake career right? A cheat, a goddamn liar. Or so the world thought, why a person who wouldn't think of cycling as way to make money or not being obsessed with winning resort to some dope? Why did he commit suicide in a car crash with the evidence conveniently disappearing? A person who said he would rise to the top to change the cycling and the sports world, to create a world without those doping cheats. Interesting right? The only person to believe in the MC, who wanted the MC to live his life without the burden of his parents expectations, why a man so loveable be so hated and stuck in a world so dark fighting alone and being betrayed. That's just a subplot, the main plot is not that clear, from my point of-view, the main plot is the MC trying to escape the shackles of the world, his parents, his enemies, himself. Developing into a closed-off and introverted person, with a calming charm to him. Frankly, it is a bit vague but take what you want from it. The romance is there but not that well done. I mean it was rough to follow at first due to the just silly things that took some chapters to clear up. I do not agree with some couples and felt some of them were too forced and others I grew attached to. The MC couple was one couple that I at first did not agree but then thank god the author made the romance somewhat nice and enjoyable. One thing that made me appreciate and value this manhwa more is the execution of the action-packed bike scenes. Not only were they well done and realistic without some crazy inhuman thins but with actual tricks that real-life people can do, but also the races were not prolonged, like there are one or two that were dragged a little bit but other than that I cannot think of a single time that I was angry due to the action. It was a well-done aspect of the manhwa and added some nice detail to the story. The so called \"villains\" are so good that I actually became angry at them and just straight-up frustrated they even existed in the story. That is a major sign that they well-done. Furthermore, the unexpected plot twists and turns were something that I did not quite expect despite being an experienced shounen fan. However, it is somewhat predictable at some points and an experienced reader should have somewhat of an idea of what some chapters will do. To sum up, I regret catching up so quick, and I am a bit shocked myself that I like it so much afterwards that even wrote a review about it because it is not perfect and I had some complaints. But that is maybe the charm to it, the flaws that regrettably exist, but in time they get better and be fixed, like a journey or a circle. I will always remember being so infuriated with the story or other things but despite that I still wanted to know what will happen to a point where I didn't care about what time it is. I just kept going where I unfortunately did not find a next chapter to read. It has something that brings nostalgia to my brain, a feel to it and a feeling that will be stuck with me like some other anime manga that I consider masterpieces.

But man oh man! I can't remember the time I cried so much. One of the most important focuses of \"Seasons of Blossom\" is how it tackles the issue of bullying, cruelty and corrupted system of most countries. This topic is handled with such sensitivity and realism that it felt like almost real. This webtoon doesn't just show the pain and struggles caused by bullying but also the journey towards healing and standing up for oneself. It's truly inspiring to ... see characters find their voice and confidence to confront their bullies. The theme of standing up not only for oneself but also for others is another heart-warming point of manhwa. It's about finding the courage to support those who can't defend themselves, which adds a layer of depth to the characters and their relationships. Because, ignorance isn't a bliss and being ignorant equals being cruel. And you can't go anywhere without love and friendship, right? Don't be scared. If you're looking for cheeky scenes, enemies-to-lovers, \"fake dating\" and all other tropes - you can find them perfectly mixed here. The way the story unfolds with every page is just heavenly. It's so smooth and raw like a warm water in the summer sea that just wraps around you with each chapter. One of the best things about \"Seasons of Blossom\" is how it connects together the stories of all its characters. It's like they're all destined by this invisible thread of life and fate, and it's done so brilliantly. Reading it felt like being back a high-schooler again. I went through all the emotions – happiness, sadness, anger, hatred and that rush of first love. It's a story that really stays with you because of how true it is to life.

I cannot recommend this Webtoon enough. It's such a joy to read, and I'm hoping my spoiler-free review will convince you to give it a try, too. Story: 10/10 This romance-drama Webtoon consists of several arcs which each focus on different relationships (though people from past arcs make appearances in future ones). Each arc tells a beautiful story and have all managed to make me bawl my eyes out. I do have to mention, however, that while the first arc (Bomi's Flower) is entirely wholesome, later ones ... do deal with some darker subject matter. If you're not comfortable with those topics, I'd still highly recommend reading the first arc. Art: 10/10 I'm in love with the art style. It's just beautiful to look at, period. Characters: 9/10 The main characters of all the arcs so far have had a great dynamic and interesting backstories/personalities. I'm only hesitant to give it a ten because some important characters haven't concluded their character arcs yet, but I have faith this score will go up as the series wraps up. Enjoyment: 10/10 I binged what was available of this series after stumbling upon its first chapter and I've been keeping up weekly ever since. It's safe to say that this series is very, very entertaining. Overall: 9/10 I'm only refraining from giving this series a 10 because it hasn't concluded yet.

The art is very vibrant and colorful and it portrays each season perfectly. The characters are also very well written and colorful. The stories are amazing especially the second season which is my current favorite. You should definitely try it I guarantee it isn’t a waste of your time!

First of all, Story: 10/10 seasons of blossom is a webtoon that is split into four different arcs, discussing about all four seasons: summer, winter, autumn/fall, and spring. each focuses on different relationships throughout (the first arc--spring--focuses on Bomi, and the second focuses on x, etcetc.). ... first arc entirely wholesome. no sadness, very wholesome, maybe angsty if you just hate a bit of a love triangle. one of my favourite things about this webtoon is particular is how author tells the story. it feels so.. smooth, a little too nice. a pleasant read and if read when updating weekly, can get a very much tearing hair out once at the end of the chapter. captivating storytelling in other words. really effective per se to hook in reader.. a lot. second arc is when it gets a bit darker so please do take care of yourself!! (2nd arc spoiler in content but just wanted to put a warning in case of those who don't know what will be included : content warnings for direct mention of suicide, very prominent in second arc) second arc will definitely spill into tears and there's no doubt of that. always crying. crying every chapter. maybe a bit of an exaggeration but it felt like that. can't really scroll without having to stop once or twice because i'm tearing up lol third arc is split into two characters who are siblings and their respective relationship. (yet again, spoiler in content for 3rd arc but those who want to know any content warnings that will be mentioned, please be aware of selfharm and mentions of suicidal thoughts) as of this review, third arc is not done but i can guarantee is a really good read so far (as expected of course!!) Art: 10/10 do i need to speak anymore of the art? the art is a beauty, no doubt. gorgeous. really gorgeous. one of the things that i found so contradicting at some parts of this story is how the art is so simple and cute, big eyes and simple lines, but yet it sometimes tell such a compelling, sad story. it's so ironic but yet it works. i.. love it. so much. really really gorgeous art. Character: 10/10 fleshened out. really fleshened. everyone has a background of their own, and have reasons behind how they act and how they are at the very day. feels a little too realistic, and that's what is good about it. author has put heavy thought into characters so much to the point i'm in awe when reading of how much they feel so real. and with the aid of such engaging storytelling that's speechlessly so good, it creates an interesting experience to read. nothing beats a good storyline and characters. nothing. i tell you. Enjoyment: 10/10 i.. literally spent ten minutes fangirling over this webtoon so wouldn't ten out of ten enjoyment to be expected? of course, some people would rate enjoyment a little different from others, especially for weekly webtoons where people could argue that because it's updated weekly and can't be bingable, it creates a worse experience. but in contrast, in my own point of view, it being weekly is something to take granted. ironically despite i want to smash my head into the ground and rip my hair out every time i finish the weekly chapter, i would still read it the week afterwards. and then the next, then the next. it's just.. too good to not. characters are good, story is good, art is gorgeous. there is nothing to not enjoy of this webtoon. Overall: 10/10 must i need to say any more?"}, {"score": "10", "content": "\"I hope you will have the courage to reach out for help one more time.\" Seasons of Blossom is a brilliantly written and emotional manhwa that shows the multiple struggles that one faces and how the characters work together to overcome those struggles. It brings an essential lesson to light that many might have gotten bored of hearing, yet it is so crucial and important to hear: You are not alone. Story: 10/10 Seasons of Blossom includes four arcs named after the seasons, each with different characters and lessons to be focused on. All four of the arcs are, as said at the beginning, beautifully written and convey ... the emotions and lives of every character amazingly and realistically. The lessons that were portrayed in every arc are easy to learn from and relate to and, like said at the end, will truly change lives. The relationships are also written beautifully, whether they be relationships that are forming, ending, or continuing to blossom. Characters: 9/10 The personality and story behind every character are very diverse and portray the reasoning behind why a character acts a certain way. The authors made almost every character easy to relate to and wrote all of them very well. This was pointed out by another reviewer, but I'd like to include that many of the characters are very reoccurring in the story and don't just appear in one arc and then never show up again, so you can end a season without worrying about when you'll see your favorite characters again. Art: 7/10 The art style is a bit simple yet very easy to recognize and it is easy to find beauty in this simplicity anyway. The artwork perfectly depicted the emotions of every character, and I enjoyed how each detail was illustrated. The only reason it isn't perfectly scored is because the style genuinely simple and there wasn't anything really special about it. However, now that this manhwa is especially memorable to me, I do think that I will be able to recognize the art style in other places if I ever happen to stumble upon it. Enjoyment: 10/10 After 1 year of reading this manhwa, I have to say that it was extremely enjoyable and there wasn't a single chapter where I was feeling bored of what was occurring. In fact, I was usually always on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what happens in the next chapter. To wrap it up, I would like to say that I genuinely believe this manhwa will save lives (I mean this quite literally) with the tear-jerking, relatable lessons that it has to give to its readers. Seasons of Blossom has the ability to make readers get emotional, whether it be happiness or sadness, and educates readers of mental struggles. During the author's note in the epilogue, Hongduck and Nenome said \"We wanted to create a work comforting and encouraging to our readers but we were the ones who were consoled and supported instead,\" and I believe that they have achieved exactly what they wanted and will continue to do such. Overall: 10/10 Mathematically speaking, my score would be a 9, but I genuinely enjoyed reading it so much that I think it deserves a 10. I highly recommend that you read this. * I wrote this when I originally finished reading this back in June of 2023 and published on Anilist. ** Forgive me, this is my first review and I'm not very good with communicating my feelings in writing."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Everything about this series is so lovable. Seasons of Blossom is definitely not your typical cheesy romance, but instead takes itself seriously and tackles themes that not all authors can execute well. By metaphorically moving through the 4 seasons with a 4 act structure, the series culminates into a sweet little tale with thoughtful overarching themes. Plot [9/10]: We start with a rather typical trope of the female lead falling in love with the shy boy rather than the \"glowingly handsome\" guy also in the class. The \"fake dating\" trope is used here which slowly develops into some genuinely cute moments between the two. Some side romance ... also happens, which adds to the atmosphere of \"spring\" being in the air. No complaints here, just a well executed little love story. In the second act, we delve into deeper themes of suicide and regret, which our characters have to learn to come to terms with. Representing \"Summer\", this act takes us through flashbacks while still remaining relevant to the core characters. There were some genuinely sad moments here, and it feels like we are really able to see the characters in a more vulnerable light. I really appreciate the change in tone of the writing, and the topics being illustrated were done very well. The third act is \"Autumn\", and we are given a \"enemies to lovers\" trope, except that the female lead also shines in some major moments that tackle the theme of bullying and the consequences that ensue. At this point, you start to realise that all the characters are related to each other, and as these characters are given more identity, the whole fictitious world gains depth. \"Winter\" comes in the fourth act, once again reiterating the themes of suicide and bullying. The author is brutal with these topics and doesn't try to overly sugarcoat it. I guess this act also serves a purpose to \"redeem\" the characters of their past guilt, by choosing to take action in solving the new bullying scenario, which has been foreshadowed throughout the entire series beforehand. I also really appreciate how the ending wasn't rushed, which a lot of webtoons struggle to do. The story ended where it needed to end, and everything was just wrapped up nicely with little loose ends to cover again. Art [9/10]: The art is nothing insane because it doesn't need to be. The style perfectly encapsulates the themes being discussed, with the earlier act having much lighter tones when compared to the later acts. It's also quite unique, and really assists the writing to bring the characters into life. Characters [9/10]: All of the characters are so likeable. Within 130 chapters, it seems as if we've gotten to know everything about these characters. There are many scenes that are dedicated to showing us the characters' pasts, and they feel like real people with aspirations, regrets and worries. The author also did a great job by intertwining all these characters in a \"web\" of connections, so that they are all linked to each other by friendships, relationships or familial ties. Enjoyment [8/10]: I initially read this up to ~90 chapters, and then reread it from the beginning. Read it all in 2 days - it's filled with moments that capture a whimsical high school romance mood, and also moments which make you look out the window and just think. Overall [9/10]: Great read, no complaints. Romance done right."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Season's of Blossom, at first, appears to be a nice romance and slice-of-life story about a group of friends. However, be warned, that this work delves into topics such as mental health, bullying, family problems, and more. I'll start with the story. there will be spoilers. you've been warned. The story is told in four arcs, or seasons, with four different 'couples.' The story is told in chronological order, with a couple of flashbacks here and there. The first season is light and funny; it is about spring and has a fake couple-falls-in-love plot. The second season is very heavy and low-key traumatized me. It is summer, ... with heavy rains and heavy heat. This season is sad and juxtaposes the happy summer with sad eyes hidden behind a smile. We lose a cherished character to suicide, and we see the repercussions of such an act on everyone else, including the audience. While I did say everything happens in chronological order, the romance aspect and character loss happens in the past. This season more so speaks about the repercussions of such an event on those left behind. The third season is autumn, and in comes the cold, and the leaves turn red. There is a main and side couple that begins here. This season also deals with heavy topics, such as bullying and self-harm in the past. This arc was rather funny, and because those actions were in the past, the audience isn't worried something bad will happen to the main character, as she has grown stronger in light of what happened. The final arc, winter, is where we witness a combination of all of the arcs. A character has been bullied (this is foreshadowed throughout the entire story), and he goes through a suicide attempt but is stopped by the rest of the characters. This arc is also very emotional, because it includes the buildup of everything that came before it, and we see that the main character of season 2 left a larger impact than everyone thought, because this season's main character's pain wouldn't have been noticed without him. There's a lot more to it, and we see that even more so when he was alive, he left a large impact on all of the characters. OKAY, now to the characters. There isn't a single character that I did not like or understand their motives. Of course, there were actions I did not agree with, but I understood each character's motivations, even the 'villains.' All of them were very complex, and none of them were one dimensional. This aspect is further amplified due to the various situations the characters go through due to the changing storylines, and the complexity of youth. My favorite character is Lee Hamin, he is the main lead for the second season, and he resonated the most with me, which made the 'reality' of the story hit so much harder. The art style is beautiful. It's simple and not complex like Van Gogh, but I prefer it that way. The simplicity of the drawings compliments the complexity of the plot. The story would have felt much different if a lot of what was being talked about by the audience was the appearance of the characters. All in all, what makes me give this work such a high rating is the message, and that I think it was successfully delivered. I won't say what it is because.... I feel like we can all reach that conclusion for ourselves. I will say please give this one a chance! and pick it up again if u dropped it! (I did put it on hold while it was updating bc the time between updates and seasons was too long, but look at me now!)"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Seasons of Blossom is a fantastic dive into relationships, mental health and bullying, the past, and learning to love yourself. As of right now, there are 4 parts to the story almost coinciding with the seasons of the year. They also come with their own changes to the perspective and main characters while still keeping the overall core cast. The best thing about this is how it allows the world to build on top of itself, recontextualizing the prior world you think you know until you realize the connections between everyone. Nothing exists in a vacuum. Everything matters somehow. This then allows for the development and ... exploration of a lot of the characters. Some people that play a minor role in one part come back to have entire stories about them in another. And not just the simple bonus chapter kind of stories, but real major 30 chapter stories. The characters that are given the spotlight from the beginning aren't pushed to the side either to make room for the new developments. Instead, they remain relevant and change too, allowing for consistent growth. Every character has something important to share and they all can make a difference. The art also is solid from the beginning, carrying a simple to digest but stylized feeling to it. Sometimes it can get too simple, but it never is too cluttered. You always can understand exactly what is going on. My only complaints really are that the paneling could be better in spots (which I guess is more inherit to the medium), and that it kinda can be misleading (But not in a bad way!). Based on the first part, you can mistakenly believe that it is mainly romance when it isn't. Sure that certainly leads the plot in multiple areas, but it certainly is more drama than romance. But honestly, I'm happy it turned out that way. The journey I took may have not been one that I initially was enamored with, and it certainly wasn't perfect from beginning to end. But what it depicts always feels meaningful and full of heart. Things stick with you and forces you to think it all over, leaving you with a range of bittersweet emotions that I can't help but be happy with."}]}

From its incredible storytelling to its breathtaking art, it’s a series that truly stands out for so many reasons. First, let’s talk about the story. At its core, the manhwa follows Jin Mu-Won, a young warrior navigating a world of betrayal, revenge, and the heavy legacy of his father's sacrifices. While that might sound like a classic martial arts tale, what sets this apart is its depth. The plot doesn’t rush but takes its time to build a rich, immersive world filled with political intrigue, alliances, and deep ... personal struggles. Every twist and turn feels earned, and the stakes are palpable throughout. The characters are another highlight. Jin Mu-Won is a protagonist who stands out not just because of his skills but because of his humanity. He’s not some overpowered hero who breezes through obstacles; instead, he faces each challenge with determination, intelligence, and a strong sense of responsibility. The supporting characters are equally nuanced, each with their own backstories, motivations, and conflicts. This makes every interaction meaningful, whether it’s with allies or enemies. The art is simply stunning. From the fluidity of the fight scenes to the meticulous detail in the environments, every panel feels alive. The combat sequences, in particular, are some of the best you’ll find in any manhwa, seamlessly blending strategy, emotion, and jaw-dropping choreography. But it’s not just about the action—the quieter, emotional moments are just as impactful, brought to life by the expressive art style. What makes \"Legend of the Northern Blade\" a masterpiece is how it balances everything: the gripping story, layered characters, and incredible visuals. It’s a manhwa that doesn’t just entertains — it resonates. Whether you’re here for the martial arts, the emotional depth, or the worldbuilding, this series delivers on every front. If you’re a fan of martial arts stories with heart, complexity, and a touch of philosophical exploration, \"Legend of the Northern Blade\" is a must-read. It’s not just a manhwa—it’s an experience."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Overall, I'm enjoying this manhwa. I like the style and the depiction of special abilities and moves. The main character of course has the usual tragic backstory, but he doesn't win all of his fights which I like, as usually the main is too OP for anything to even phase them. Most of the side characters also have reasonably good backstories, with the main getting stronger and wiser as he continues. The fight scenes are also extremely well done, with quite calculated and precise battles taking place. There are lots of different sects and 'groups' so it isn't just the 'good vs evil' troupe which ... helps to add more intrigue.

The character designs are varied and unique, and each could likely be recognized simply from their silhouettes. The artstyle might be offputting at first, but soon you will realize that is amazing whilst being stylized. The fights are actually nearing Sakamoto Days level of action, with incredible choreography and effects. ... Secondly, the hype for this manhwa is nearly unparalleled. A bit in, it gives off a similar vibe to Solo Leveling, in that you want to scream from the coolness factor of it all. The characters are written well, there is development, a great backstory, politics, revenge, and setting. Well, the setting is a little generic due to the usage of Murim and martial clans, but it manages not to go too cliché or overbloated. I would say the only thing about this manhwa that doesn't live up to its potential is the discard of the mc's blacksmithing skills, which are never mentioned again after the midpoint. There was much nuance and mystery to be discovered there, gone unfulfilled. Perhaps we'll see its re-emergence, however - I have faith in the author.

It was then that he started to forge his on ways for 7 years untill he finally got up to what is going on; his (not literal) uncle went missing and that means he had to save the person he loves.

At a complete 202 chapters, the story is tight with zero fat and the pacing is ridiculous - even the worst plot points are justified satisfyingly. This is easily the best murim comic I've seen and it's in contention with Top Tier Providence for being the best Chinese-fantasy type comic ever made. I've never seen a better example of a over-powerful MC in a series before - once you realise the true scope of the world the power scaling becomes very obvious. Rarely ... ever are characters this three dimensional in media, let alone manhwa. Gone are the atypical Korean characters that are evil for evil's sake, or the guy who switches side like nobody's business. These characters develop and change with every chapter, you can really see the intentions behind all of their actions. While the entire manhwa is a complete package, the combat is down-right impressive. The artist manages to sell the combat as if it's animated itself, with intricate depictions of dodging and hand-to-hand combat that any martial art fan will love. I've never seen a better depiction of sword fighting put to paper and I've read hundreds of action comics."}, {"score": "9", "content": "It's a bit of a shame the final arc was rushed, but considering what the artist went through in his personal life, the fact that the fight choreography and art remained so good is already praiseworthy enough. Despite the aforementioned rush, LotNB remains by far the best murim manhwa. To go a bit more in depth - It's a revenge story through and through - set in a murim setting, one we've seen in manhwa in countless stories, as this one does not really stray from the well established setting nearly whatsoever, as the one big change to the usual \"unorthodox\" or \"demonic\" sects in the world ... is the existence of the mysterious \"Silent Night\", which acts as the nemesis for the orthodox sects of this world. Little is known about the Silent Night, only that the murim must be protected - and protected it is, by our main protagonist's, Jin Mu-Won's, sect - the Northern Heavenly Sect. As the threat of the Silent Night is squandered by the power of the Northern Heavenly Sect, the Sect Leader, Jin's father, is swiftly betrayed by the murim alliance. Thus begins the path of bloodshed and vengeance - but what sets LotNB apart from your average murim story, is that Jin is neither infallible, nor omnipotent, nor omniscient and requires genuine help from his allies, who contribute greatly for the story to move forward. Jin meets people and grows, not only physically but also mentally - his worldview is shaped as the story progresses and does not remain stagnant throughout. This experience is welcome and greatly enhances the story, as all the characters that appear serve a greater purpose than be simple mcguffins like 90+% of other manhwa. The fight choreography had me reading very slowly, as each page was so wondrously drawn that one can't help but get lost at how wonderful it is. The beginning parts of the story have quite rocky art, as it seemed that the artist was only starting to find his groove, but it later develops into stunning page after page.

Especially the characters facial expressions/tiny details throughout each panel (try not to scroll them too fast otherwise you'll miss all the tiny/small details of ... each panel). The story had my emotions going through infinite ups and downs, I was unable to guess accurately for almost every plot point or plot twist, really enjoy stories like this where I can't guess a single thing right. When each arc peaked, the action scenes had me hyped to the point where I had to take constant breaks lol. If you give this manhwa time, it will build into something beautiful completely worth reading (it's a hidden gem). A story where each decision made impacts you, each fight makes you think, each consequence leaves you wondering where it goes from here. You will be fully immersed in no time.

The story is intense, emotional, and filled with brutal but beautifully drawn fight scenes. What really stands out is the unique art style and the deep bond between the main character and his enemies – especially the final antagonist, who’s more than just a villain. Jin Mu-Won’s journey from isolation to becoming a near-mythical swordsman is tragic, powerful, and unforgettable. The final arc felt a bit rushed, but it still made sense and gave proper closure. This series gave me chills multiple times.

The art is fairly good too. But, that's all there is about it. Cultivation manhwa/ manhua with OP MC being the korean/ chinese counterpart of our old good antiquated nekketsu shonen. If you like that kind of manhwa, you'll like it, if not... So, that's a 6 but a 6 as a cultivation manhwa. If i'd be to mark it as an artpiece, I would put a 2 despite the fact I pretty enjoyed it. Like, you know, entertainment doesn't always mean quality. However, it has no pretention of being anything else than an entertainment. Ergo, to conclude, ...

{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/164926/Webtoon_Character_Na_Kang_Lim", "reviews": [{"score": "9", "content": "This is not the first time I have added a random manhwa to my reading list and it ended up exceeding my expectations. (I should check out some more, I guess.) ‘Webtoon Character Na Kang Lim’ is enjoyable for the most part, even more so if you do not mind reading a near-identical execution of the ‘Re:Zero’ formula. Plot(7/10): As the synopsis suggests, the protagonist here finds himself solving the problems of webtoon waifus as he is the only one who knows the upcoming events of their lives. And he loops every time he fails to do so. This is where it gets a bit more ... intriguing. He does not need to die to repeat the events, it just automatically happens after every failed attempt. I mean, he dies, the heroines also die at times, but death is not the trigger for looping. And unlike Subaru, he always knows the events beforehand and can prepare for them in most cases, whereas Subaru has to die every time to get a better understanding of the situation. The situation and events get altered because of him not being the protagonist and doing things differently than the original webtoon. Characters(7/10): Na Kang Lim is the protagonist of the story who does everything that a harem protagonist usually does. He solves the problems of the female characters and gives them emotional support, and in the process, everyone starts to fall for him. As clichéd as it can be. He is dense and cannot catch any hints from the heroines until one of them says it out loud. He does not get much character development throughout the course of the 100+ chapters I have read so far. The female characters are also the typical types. The author has given them just enough personality and backstory to make their respective story arcs engaging. Art(7/10): Though the art lacks originality, which always gives an extra point, it was decent. I cannot say they were totally consistent, but nothing felt wrong with the slight adjustments they made in the later chapters. The characters look nice, and that is what matters the most. Enjoyment(8/10): The reason I am writing this review is probably that I enjoyed this manhwa a lot more than I thought I would. It has a nice balance of comedy and drama. There are some genuinely funny jokes and references that can make you laugh. The pacing of the story felt right, the characters are not as dull as I thought. Overall, a solid use of the time-loop formula. If you are tired of Japanese harem mangas and looking for something slightly different than usual, this might be the manhwa you should read. This is pretty good, considering how it handled the whole time-loop concept. And cute waifus are just a bonus on top of that. Update: In addition to all the good things I’ve already mentioned about this manhwa, it had a fantastic final arc and a satisfying ending. I'm giving it a 9 now. A must-read if you're into harem-comedy, and it should easily surpass your expectations."}, {"score": "9", "content": "9.0/10 Am I seeing this correctly? A Webtoon added onto MyAnimeList, and an absolute banger one at the very least? I honestly think I’m a bit too overqualified or biased to write a review on this manwha, since I’ve been through thick-and-thin with its translation, community, etc., so much that I swear I’ve already wrote a review on this on a different website, but I can’t find it. Anyways, if you will ignore my sentimental backstory then I have nothing but praises for this story: I will be the first one to say that the premise had me absolutely hooked — not only are time-loop/loop upon death ... stories so interesting, but a time-loop story revolving around the concept of a harem is, from what I knew back then and presently, basically unheard of. Though, I will also state that the momentum and interest does die down after a few twists and surprises in the middle of the first thirty chapters because the plot seems to be a bit basic and cliche with a wimpy mc who constantly faces reality checks — yet, this is one of the main reasons you allow a story to fully flesh itself out and develop before forming an opinion, as I couldn’t have been more wrong. The main reason why “Webtoon Character Na Kang Lim” has made me brainwashed into such a hardcore fan over the years is solely due to the character development and characters themselves. Each character comes off a bit cliche and archetypal at first, which should, in theory, make for some boring developments; however, each character is developed so uniquely with their own twists in their personality to make them lovable — the best quality in any harem story. This especially includes and applies to the main character, as you basically experience a “oh, how the tables have turned” reaction to some parts of the story solely due to how much the main character has developed from his past self from his life-and-death experiences. Though I have high praises for this, this story has also lost me a lot of times solely due to how ridiculous the plot is at times, making for some rather sloppy writing and developments jumbled in — this especially applies to the later chapters, as the author doesn’t seem to know what to write anymore, and the resolutions/tensions are a bit unsatisfying or random. I mean, my major criticism is rushing over some fmc character arcs, making certain characters (you’d know who) feel misplaced and wasted. Yet, I still love my entire experience with the manwha despite some of the flaws — that is a testament to how well-developed the characters were to brainwash me to this extent, to make me continue loving a story with a messy plot. If you read this, maybe try not to become obsessed as me, and give the story time to fully flourish, as I had previously rated (unofficially) this as a 7.7/10, and I would’ve regretted that for eons. This has some of the best character development in the manwha scene, and I get feelings of a proud father watching the main character grow, and I don’t even know what that feels like, since I definitely don’t have a child, but I’m guessing that’s what it would feel like. Anyways, I’m rambling; give this time, and you’ll love this. Oh, before I leave, did I mention the RETURN BY DEATH + HAREM CONCEPT IS JUST AMAZING. I NEED MORE OF THIS. … I just realized that I have no idea who best girl is after 161 chapters… anywho, go read this. It’s 2:30 a.m., and you could probably tell from my writing, ok.

The issue is the protagonist didn't come with them, but all the conflicts did. Kang Lim takes it upon himself to save these girls and reach a happy ending, because they're his favorite characters And here in lies why I give this manhwa a 10/10. The characters. Intially it seems like your average anime tropes. The harsh tsundere (Da Hee), the deredere (Miya), the yandere (Na Ri), Mesugaki, Childhood ... friend, etc. First lets start of with the protagnist himself. Na Kang Lim. Having re read the story I came to the realization that fundamentally... Na Kang Lim doesn't change much. But thats ok. Hes a good person from start to finish, an otaku from start to finish, and a \"I hate myself\" type from start to finish. Its what DOES change about him, the little it is that makes this manhwa great. Kang Lim learns that its ok for him to be loved, and that its not because he's stepping in for the protagonist of ESW the reason why the girls fall for him, its because they love HIM, and only him, which wraps beautifully in what seems to be the climax arc. I won't spoil anything. He realizes that he doesn't love the characters of ESW, but the people who came from there. They're not characters, they're people, they have their own experiences, troubles, and lives, and Kang Lim realizes that that's what he loves, (and Jung Ah who's not from ESW). He learns that he isn't a loner and he thrived when he's with others and it breaks him when they're seemingly gone. Next we have the heroines. To save time in this review I'll say that each heroine had at LEAST one very impactful arc that makes you want to cheer for them more than any of the others. Each girl has their moments and I would completely understand why Kang Lim chooses that girl, should it not be the harem ending. They also change a lot in the story and they grow as people with Kang Lim. There are 7 main heroines. In order of their appearance in the merged world (even in just cameos) it would be Yoo Da Hee, Park Jung Ah, Seo Chun Ja, Cha Sirin, Yoo Na Ri, Ju Ra Mi and Kwon Miya. Maybe Kang Lim would choose Ra Mi with their shared loneliness, or Cha Sirin both being people learning to fit in and getting out of their shell, or Jung Ah, always being there for Kang Lim even when times are tough, being the girl who liked him even before the arrival of the heroines, or Da Hee, the poster girl and her and Kang Lim discovering their love for each other slowly, or Na Ri, needing someone to handle her because she needs someone to tell her that she can do it, or maybe even Kwon Miya, who Kang Lim thinks he failed and regrets not being there for her when she needed it each girl has multiple (this being a glorified oversimplification) reasons why they can be chosen as the harem winner, thats if it isn't a harem ending, which as the reviewer is what I personally would prefer The main antagonist is also great. However they're also a massive spoiler so I will not be saying anything here. I will say the author does a good job making them likeable and funny but also hateable and you can't help but wish they lose, a classic good villian. The setting of WCNKL is great too. It's like Re Zero as a high school drama but it definitely has its own identity. It's more light hearted than Re Zero but also deals with heavy topics like suicide, stalking, and obsession and still manages to hold its key as a romcom first while not being insulting to the topics its handling. Overall Webtoon Character Na Kang Lim is a fun story about love and overcoming loneliness, its a story I would recommend to anyone who's interested in the harem genre and anyone looking to read and binge a heartwarming story about a completely lonely otaku loser."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I've read this manhwa 3 weeks ago and oh my, I find another great harem plot here. Why I stated that? When u try to read this one, u'll find a well written story with stunning illutration. Every heroine here get their turn with the MC. Did u know why some harem mangas are failing nowaday? That's because they just dropped the \"harem\" tag to bait the readers and then focusing the plot for just a heroine and give no chance for another heroines LOL. They just want to write a basic romance with a harem bait. Of course, some readers will prefer the MC to ... only with a heroine at the end. I know that well and I respect that. But, my focus is the middle of story. WCNKL is written with a good proportion for every heroine in every arc. So that, if Na Kang Lim ended with just a woman, I won't complain about that. That's author right to write the end as he wishes. I'll still say this one good because every heroine was did her best to get an ending with the MC and none of them had no panels in the manhwa. At last, I recommend this one for y'all to read. It will remind us how the harem genre should be written and show that a lot of authors were forgetting it. Thank you for reading *sorry for my confusing review, I ain't a native English speaker :)"}, {"score": "10", "content": "10.0/10.0 Reading the first few chapters had me suspicious of that \"mid\" harem trope where ah, the MC saves a heroine one by one and the heroine falls in love with him just because of his heroic act of saving them and eh the MC was just doing it to survive sorta thing. Yet, the more I read it, the more I deem myself completely wrong. Na Kang Lim gives more than what the average so-called \"harem protagonist\" does. Other than saving them, he also spends time with ALL of the heroines equally without any deception whatsoever. His true personality is the sole element that ... makes them fall in love with him. This is what makes him a charming character above other protagonists, he deserved it. Them liking him isn't a result of him having knowledge of the Webtoon he read before but because it's him, Na Kang Lim. I think that's the truest essence of a real harem. Na Kang Lim is also not some sore loser or maniac that is adamant about their beliefs, he matured overtime. Although it's caused by his hundreds of time loops, he didn't spiral into madness, but rather use that chance to try again and improvise. Throughout the whole series, he has never given up (as I remember) and went through with it until the last strand of hope. He ultimately had a strong resolve to do the best he can do even though the odds may be stacked against him. Most MC's resolution would be chaotic, but he's pretty coolheaded in the long run. I don't know if I'm biased or not but a non-psychopathic MC is a nice change of pace for me. Personally, this might be the best harem manhwa that I've ever read, heck I might even challenge the fact that it is the best piece of literature someone could ever make. I don't think there could be another manhwa as peak as this one for another 10-20 years, which is kinda sad. Some other good aspects to point out is how the plot flows so naturally between scenes, every character is lovable in their own ways and they all get the amount of screen times that they deserve (a critique would be a little lack of interaction between Na Kang Lim and Eun-Young but it was minor), the interaction between characters is sometimes funny, sometimes touching, sometimes it just hits right in my heart :\")"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Fuck man, I cannot believe this beautiful manhwa has finally concluded. On one end, I never want to let this series go, I wanna hug it tightly and see all of the cute stories in-between and after the time skip (and maybe we might even get Epilogues). But on the other end, I'm so glad it ended at the perfect point AND it got the perfect conclusion it deserved. That final set of panels will gladly live rent free in the back of my head for the rest of my life. Another thing I appreciate alot is the fact that the author never once rushed ... anything in this series, especially the ending. They always took their time to make you believe these relationships are truly special and one of a kind. Every single one is unique and beautiful in their own right. This is why I truly believe that this is one of the very few harems that actually work, because the author cares sososo much about every single character, even the antagonists. To conclude all of my praises, I'll say this. You will never find another series like Webtoon Character Na Kang Lim. That is simply the truth. Thank you so much WCNKL for simply existing and even changing my life in some ways, I'm gonna miss you so badly."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Often I get disgusted with harem. Girls are needlessly introduced just to seemingly expand the mcs pokedex, just a couple girls are focused on showing obvious favoritism, the later girls are overshadowed by the first ones, incoherent ecchi scenes happen way to often (not that it's necessarily a bad thing ofc), things get predictable, and so on. However, this harem manhwa really does the harem genre justice, staying true to the 'harem' side of things. All the girls get a spot on stage (well, eventually at least) and remain in the spotlight throughout the manhwa. Favorites can easily be made later on and love for old ... ones can remain. Literally just as a harem story, it passes with above perfect scores. But not only because it is a good harem manhwa is this read so good. The characters are very likable, attractive, cute, se... um, interesting. The scenarios are fun to read and so is seeing the mc suffer. The chunni and magical hacker girl arc was top tier, and so was all the other things people are listing. Just go read the other reviews to understand why else it so good (im just tryna focus on the girls here) Well anyway, I've seen a decent amount of harem, but honestly this one was among, if not contending with the best for it's harem side of things.

Manhwas have been popping up in great numbers over the past few years to the point where not even I can keep up with them. I remember seeing this title being randomly recommended and figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. Now 170 chapters later, the series has finally ended. In short, this series is an incredibly unique series of a \"what if\" scenario if your known Webtoon Characters came to real life. The most impressive aspects lie with the MC supposedly being a regular guy, who shows incredible development and growth. I would ... even say he's the most relatable to us the readers. There isn't anything particularly special about him, his only advantage is prior knowledge of a webtoon. Yet it works so damn well, he sticks to his resolve to follow through and ensure he reaches the goal.

This is one of the best harem work I’ve ever encountered. Still i have to said there are some issues with this manhwa, such as a few characters feeling underdeveloped (you whould know who after reading it) and certain topics being glossed over, though it is still an enjoyable and memorable read for me. To begin with The protagonist is a standout. Despite fitting into the 'dense and bland-looking protagonist' archetype, his character is nuanced and evolves meaningfully as the story progresses. What makes him truly unique is how his dense nature is portrayed—it feels intentional and is explored as part of his growth, ... with him eventually recognizing this aspect of himself. It’s rare to see such thoughtful writing in this genre, and it elevates the entire story to something special. To expound further, the female cast is incredibly well-written, each feeling like a genuine, three-dimensional person rather than just background props or possessions like many other same genre works."}, {"score": "7", "content": "I am going to keep this very simple: this series should suck. Just looking at the tropes used, this should suck. It's got it all; time loops, harems, all the different female love interest tropes, transported to another world, all that. By all rights this should not be a good series. The reason this series actually manages to be the exception to this rule is simple; unlike practically every other series that uses these tropes, the author isn't a talentless hack just throwing tropes at his story in an attempt to cater to one audience, he actually puts some thought into making everything work within ... the story he set up.

Really fuelled my need/addiction for the bestkind of romance there is. I think the reason why I really loved this is that work is because it felt like it took the best parts of other works and improved them all to 1000%, giving everyone a happy ... ending, making the only problem I have with it is that there isn't MORE. In the beginning, the interactions between kang lim and da hee are very reminiscent to the ones in nichijou, kang lim reminds me of an optimistic hachiman from oregairu, and the whole saving heroines thing reminds me of if her flag breaks and the world god only knows. But none of them manaaged to have the balls to finish strong with that ending, but even besides that, everything was executed so beautifully. The turmoil of the characters are so in depth and very nuanced, you would be heartless not to root for them. Overall, it really is the greatest harem story ever written.

Not only the MC, but same goes to all these female protagonists. Great arts as well. The reader can feel the intense and impacts of the emotions in his arts. He knows how to combine and put the line and borders in his art. Salute to the author because he can imagine far away further beyond what ... the readers are thinking. Plot (especially) and the storyline also well-developed. It is hard for me to compliment how the manwha put their plot & storyline when the chaps are going on because it require a lot of planning and great imaginations as well, somehow the author able to put all the puzzle together (especially the Eun Yong and Ra Mi story at the last few chaps). Not forgetting the MC bestfriend and other supporting character as well, Yong-Su and Bang Yerim, the author also include the great plots at the last few chaps and their storyline in this manwha.

Every single chapter was exciting, every single plotline was intriguing, and the seven heroines were all astounding. The author was somehow able to make every single heroine in the series best girl. Every single time that I thought that one of the girls was going to be just okay, the author somehow made the girl a top-tier waifu. And Kang-Lim's just an incredibly written main character. He isn't dense to the point where he becomes unlikeable. He's pretty much just like a normal kid who doesn't jump to conclusions and I really like that about ... him. And for me, he's painfully realistic. When it comes to Harem anime, manga, or manhwa there's bound to be a debate on who is the best girl. But as I said, this series somehow made it near impossible to choose because of how good every single heroine was. But by the slightest of margins, my favorites were Seo Eun-Young and Yoo Na Ri. BUT JUST BARELY to the point that all of them were pretty much equal. And for the side characters? Dude, Yong-Soo's MY MANS and I'm so glad that he was also able to get an amazing arc and ending.

Except, while the original main character was charismatic, popular and most importantly supernaturally strong, Kang-lim is none of these things. The bulk of the story is Kang-Lim 'saving' and bonding with the girls that appear in the original webtoon in your classic harem/visual novel style. The gimmick here is that the story is pretty self aware regarding the clichés and tropes of the genre. All of this ... in a vacuum would make for a very interesting take on this classic harem approach. However, I believe it falls flat in the excution. For how 'in the know' this webtoon wants to appear it really fails at the adressing the biggest issues you'd generally find in a harem series. It never dares to truly question the faith characters have in the MC nor does the MC ever truly have to make a decision that negatively affects his relationship with the girls. The idea of the main character actively not trying to be dense really falls apart if he acknowledges the issues that exist and yet does nothing to counteract them. This is especially frustrating at times when the story does cut through a trope. Because it really tricks you into thinking the result will differ from the expectation, but instead each time nothing really happens that I would personally call surprising. The main character is, as expected from a harem protagonist, uncool, a loner, and weak in name only. In reality he only views and portrays himself this way because of the image others have of him. He already has friends including a girl that is in love with him in the first chapter, is effortlessly cool and endlessly charming once you get to know him and obviously good looking as well, after a haircut which he cannot get before this point due to personal reasons ofcourse.... Having said this, being generic at times is not a crime and I don't think this series is a particularly bad offender. It is just that because of the image of selfawareness that it is going for that these things stand out like a sore thumb. There is a lot to like here, The characters are interesting and all likeable for different reasons. The arc story lines and the backstory for the main character are maybe not super unique but actually pretty fun and well executed. Ofcourse this is not always the case, I think that some of the more action oriented ones kinda fall flat. I think that this story is at its best when the main character has yet to find his footing. The first arc is really strong in this regard, so is the much much later backstory arc, in the flashbacks atleast. Sadly the issues I mention are really amplified in the last 20 chapters or so. The core issue of the series not wanting to challenge Kang-Lim's convictions past a certain point becomes blatantly obvious near the end. Any mental turmoil thrown at him from a certain point in the story onward just feels like an excuse for the reader to feel bad for him and for the girls to give him a pep talk. He no longer changes, everything else is just changed around him. The ending is just the ultimate culmination of this and falls very flat. If you ask me I would say it goes against the character of the comic and is the ultimate irony for a story that pretends selfawareness as much as is done here."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Actually, for the first 20 chapters, this is an interesting comic when the main character said he would save his favorite heroine, but after that, I don't understand why he did it to the other heroines which made him break his word, yes, I know this is a harem genre, but for some reason I didn't get good character development for the heroines. main character, Na Kang Lim, is the definition of a cliche harem protagonist: plain, dense, and lacking any real development.

{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/147171/Eleceed", "reviews": [{"score": "4", "content": "*Minor Spoilers* [Introduction] Before I begin, I want to state that Eleceed is a manhwa with wholesome moments and hilarious comedy tidbits. Reading it can be enjoyable. Nevertheless, I feel like sharing some of its poor story-related elements since every other review here on MAL does not overview Eleceed's negative parts in great detail. [Main Character] To start, let us tackle its main character, Jiwoo. In fighting stories, you almost always have a protagonist who grows as they experience adversity. In Eleceed, however, Jiwoo's personality never changes, even after experiencing torture, abduction, fights, and more. No matter what happens to him, he remains a wholesome, angelic fluffball of positive ... energy. During slice-of-life moments, his personality is great. He feeds stray cats, hangs out with friends, and more. However, seriously speaking, you would imagine his personality to shift after everything he goes through. [Plot Convenience Part 1 - Overarching Master] Moving on, Eleceed features an overarching master who mentors Jiwoo. While I will not elaborate much on this individual, they essentially ruin all the tension in the story. When Jiwoo wants to become stronger, the master provides top-tier assistance. When Jiwoo finds himself in difficult situations, the master always arrives to save the day. When Jiwoo becomes terminally injured with an incurable condition, the master uses his connections to save him. Because of the presence of Jiwoo's master, no conflict ever feels serious since we, as readers, always know everything will turn out alright. Moreover, because of the master, the author often gets away with creating hopelessly impossible scenarios since he knows he can resolve any situation conveniently through the master. [Plot Convenience Part 2 - Befriending Enemies] Earlier, I mentioned the main character being a bundle of positive energy. The author uses said energy to befriend almost every enemy that appears after a fight. When Jiwoo fights a neighborhood kid, they become friends a few chapters later. When Jiwoo spars against a school bully, they become pals later. Etc, etc, you get the point. For whatever reason, most enemies become allies after they fight the protagonist to help him fight greater enemies. [Plot Convenience Part 3 - Forced Plotlines With Idiotic Explanations] Eleceed has a lot of events that severely buff Jiwoo's opposition with impossibly ridiculous advantages for seemingly outlandish reasons. A blatant example of this is when one of the world's top experts fails to prevent an assault, all because they forgot their battle animal at home (and became useless as a result). Later, they explained that the animal was too expensive to maintain, which is an absurd excuse considering their obligation to protect many students under them. Besides this, there are many other instances of forced plotlines with useless explanations, but I will not cover them since it is hard to describe them without spoiling much of the story. [Formulation Part 1 - Action Arcs] Building off my second plot convenience part, I want to explain Eleceed's formula for action arcs (not including arcs with conflict directly against the main antagonists). Personally, this story's weakest part is the fact that it often recycles the same story-line that goes: 1. Jiwoo and his buds have opposition. 2. Each side trash talks and banters to add fuel to the fire of their conflict. 3. Both sides spar. 4. After fighting, the main cast are the winners overall. 5. Both sides power up through training. 5. When new opposition appears, both sides join together to fight back. 6. The same cycle repeats on a larger scale. [Formulation Part 2 - Main Character Battles] Beyond action arc recycling, Eleceed also uses formulation for Jiwoo's battles. Of course, not every battle follows obvious formulas, but most essentially follow three paths: {If the enemy is stronger yet not overpowered} 0. ^ Happens every action arc 1. Enemy underestimates Jiwoo. 2. Jiwoo goes on a mini-training arc. 3. Jiwoo fights the enemy and seems to be worse off. 4. Jiwoo charges his one-shot move against the enemy and wins. {If the enemy is weaker} 1. Jiwoo beats them up and wins. {If the enemy is overpowered and cocky} 1. Jiwoo is beaten hard. 2. Jiwoo charges his one-shot move, and the enemy accepts it with open arms. 3. The enemy is affected, compliments the one-shot move, and keeps fighting. 4. The master intervenes to save Jiwoo. [Conclusion] I have more points I could cover, but to be genuinely honest, this review has taken 3 hours to write, and I am out of motivation to keep writing. In short, consider these points before deciding to pick up this story: - Eleceed often leverages plot convenience to contrive unrealistic scenarios. - The main character has an unrealistically optimistic personality. - Arcs often follow predictable formulas. For those expecting a well-written, look elsewhere since better stories exist. This story has good comedy and wholesomeness, so if you are interested in its slice-of-life aspects, perhaps this is worth reading. You can check out the other Eleceed reviews if you want more elaboration on stuff like that."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Finally, Eleceed has it's own MAL page! When I found the official release on Webtoons in 2020, i'd never even heard of it before - but, being fairly bored, I decided i'd spend the rest of my day reading it. I'm pretty glad to say that i've never regretted my actions. This story is fairly simple, but engaging - Jiwoo, the wholesome, positive energy is it's protagonist, and we follow his journey into the complex world of superpowered people known as the \"Awakened\". But he isn't alone; the deuteragonist, Kayden, is known as one of the stronged Awakened ones alive, but unfortunately for him, he is ... forced to place his conscience into the body of a cat, leading him to rely on Jiwoo for help. Over the story, various kinds of abilities are introduced, and with superpowers comes superhumans, who make up the wide range of characters that make up the story. Each of the main characters are given a great deal of depth and development after their introduction, and the story is constantly introducing interesting new plotlines, characters and obstacles to overcome - many characters are known as \"affiliated\", being members of larger organisations that help to build the world of Eleceed, both within Korea and internationally. The Art is amazing - fights are colourful and impactful, and the character designs are unique and consistent - its amazing how chapters are released just 7 days apart. One of my favourite things about the fights has to be the panelling - everything is clear and easy to understand, even during the fastest moments of combat. Eleceed has an amazing balance of it's various tones - it is often quite lighthearted, with many hilarious moments that have made me laugh out loud, but they never get in the way of more intense or emotional moments. It's always engaging, in many ways. Eleceed, in short, is a fun, exciting, hilarious, powerful story with great characters, colourful art, an interesting story and, most important, is INCREDIBLY entertaining. I always anticipate the next chapter, its very fun to read. 10/10"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Eleceed doesn't just write a linear story, it illustrates a scene like no other. In each panel there is constant movement, background characters fighting and laughing, side conversations and interactions. There was never a dull moment for me reading this manwha. -Story- [9/10] The plot is great, but nothing too new or unique. In fact, I've seen a lot of these concepts before. It is how Eleceed creatively fuses them, and the flawless execution that puts the cherry on top. From what I can see, the superpowers feed on a mana/energy of sorts, similar to some cultivation manhua I've read before, but it is less martial ... arts based than manhua. Expect something similar to My Hero Academia but (in my opinion) done much much better. -Art- [9/10] Their previous work on Girls of the Wilds shows. The action is clean, energetic and easy to follow. The shading is easy on the eyes too. It is soft but has a nice contrast, and that contrast is ramped up to the tension of the scene accordingly. -Characters- [10/10] If I could give the characters an 11/10 I would. The characters have distinct designs and the personalities to match. The main cast, the supporting cast, they're all great. The side character have a way of weaving their way back into the story. Almost no character is forgotten and there isn't a dull character throughout. Eleceed has a way of handing you a pile of trashy people and 1 by one- not just redeeming them but turning them into your favorite characters in the story. Specifically Jisuk and Subin's dynamic has me rolling on the floor in laughter but the same can be said about so many others. I didn't see many reviews on here so I thought to add on a little but this was kinda rushed ngl so sorry for the messy review lol"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Saying that this was a joy to read honestly feels like a huge understatement. The story follows our protagonist, Jiwoo, who is a kind-hearted cat lover and our second main character, Kayden, who is an egotistical secret agent stuck in the body of a cat. I really don't want to say much more since the story is best experienced blind. The art is consistent and the fight scenes are very well choreographed and easy to follow. The characters and their dynamics with each other are some of the most fun parts of this story. Jiwoo is so wholesome and his positive energy is infectious. Kayden is the ... complete opposite of Jiwoo, but also the perfect compliment to his personality. The other characters are just as entertaining. The characters also receive a lot of development as the story progresses and their friendships strengthen as new opponents are introduced. The comedy in this webtoon had me wheezing and smiling like an idiot, but the story can also pull off emotional moments as well as more serious moments. The action scenes had me as excited as an overly hyped youtube reactor. I was thoroughly entertained throughout every chapter. Just read it. There is a reason that it's one of the highest rated series on the webtoon platform with a rating of 9.9"}, {"score": "6", "content": "This Manwha is incredibly entertaining, I've binged it a lot. Fantastic power fantasy with great art, likeable characters and some comedic elements sprinkled in. This is what you're getting, don't expect more. This manwha is no masterpiece, just turn your brain off and be entertained. It can be formulaic and predictable, with characters repeating the same lines over and over in response to the same kinds of things. And while I say the characters are likeable, they are not very interesting characters. They have very little depth to them. ** some love interest spoilers at the end, plus minor \"plot\" spoilers ** [world building] The world building ... is not good, it's moreso an excuse to keep getting characters to fight each other, and create artificial hierarchies. That being said, whenever they attempt to flesh out the world a bit more, the arc tends to be extra boring. I also don't think world building is actually important for this kind of story because it's mostly just a plot device, but if you stop to think about it (which I can't help doing), it just doesn't make sense. * First of all, it's stupid that they can just handwave their way out of school like that and expect to graduate. They're all effectively high school dropouts in terms of their knowledge. None of these characters are developing any good life skills except fighting (which is stupid that this can be considered a good life skill). And holy crap the excuses that they make to get them out of school are so bad. I realize that it's a gag, but it comes at the cost of taking anything beyond the fighting seriously. * Jinwoo is a terrible neighbour. I feel like he would get so many noise complaints. * They also never talk about anything that these associations do, despite training their recruits and owning companies. For all the reader knows, all Jiyoung does for her ceo just is sit at a desk and do nothing all day. She doesn't seem to be remotely busy, despite everyone saying that she is. Do the associations (except I guess the ones that do r&d) exclusively have the building to host a large training area that is only ever used for sparring? * Also how the heck do the awakeners even survive without letting the rest of society know that they exist? They don't contribute anything to normal society. And for the people who do decide to run companies, most people probably wouldn't even be that good at it since their education and experience is probably terrible given the amount of time they dedicate to training. And how do the subordinates of the associations get paid? Are they also milking the companies that they own without providing any value to them? Do you really think that the companies wouldn't realize that their money is being redistributed like this? It would probably greatly hinder the company. * The word money has never ever been mentioned in this manwha. Who knows how Jinwoo gets his money to keep feeding for every little pet on the street (which mind you makes them dependent on it and means they can't do these things themselves). It's never mentioned how the heck Jinwoo can live alone like he does. Seems like neglectful parenting to me and the mom should feel bad. It's stupid how this neglectful parenting has never affected Jinwoo a bit. I don't know what the procedures would be, but I'm sure in reality there's no way this could have happened without someone figuring out and attempting to fix it. * Also for the people who don't have an association, aren't they literally unemployed? How do they make money? How do they afford to live? I feel like this should matter. * I also don't get why the awakener world is so dead set on being strong. Yea sure you can 1v1 whoever you want and can make people bow to you, but that's about all that it gives you. You still have no say in the real world since awakeners don't exist according to them. Also no one's powers are used for anything other than combat. There are some who have non-combat abilities, but these might as well be useless abilities despite what they may say. Some people also have really useful powers, like Jinwoo's speed. However, he never uses it for anything useful. * There are other parts of the world building which are alright, but generally not very interesting and often are just tropes. Power system is fine. It doesn't have any strict rules so the author can do whatever the heck they want, but it generally makes sense. It's also not at all based on physics, which is sad for me, but you can't expect too much from a turn-your-brain-off manwha. [action] The action is entertaining but the power system doesn't have any strict rules meaning that the author can do whatever they want. Sometimes Jinwoo can go in and punch them in the face, except when he can't I guess. The action looks cool and it's frequent. * Fights, especially high level fights, tend to be a spectacle of some element flying from one person to the other. Mist, iron, wind, lightning, fire, ice, psychic stuff, green stuff, red x's, poison, purple tentacles. It's all the same. They sometimes say there's differences and that some things counter other things, but I'm never convinced. These aren't fleshed out abilities, they don't have rules, they just look cool. There are some variations to these, such as a reflecting ability, but these aren't fully fleshed out since the fight is too flashy to tell exactly what's happening. They just say what it did after the damage was done. There's some mind control type ones, but these are never too important. There are some body transformation ones, and ones that just make you stronger but these are also ultimately quite boring. I feel like the powers were only interesting with the low level people without an association since they had rules and they did inventive things. None of these power ultimately were useful though. * Fights, and people's reactions to fights, also tend to go the same way all the time. They keep underestimating the MC, then going all out, then failing anyways. There are rarely any mixups that happen in these fights. There are never any stakes. And people are always surprised by Jinwoo's power, and are always saying \"wow I didn't think he was the kind of person to do this\". The reactions to the fights get really repetitive. [plot] Ah yes, almost forgot, plot. You don't read this for the plot. You read it for the power fantasy and I guess the romantic sideplot which is there every once in a while. * The plot is mostly a series of excuses to either get Jinwoo or Kayden to fight people (and I guess the others too). It's mostly caused by people picking fights, people just wanting to fight because sparring. They'll find a reason to fight, don't worry about it. * One notable thing about this manwha is that there isn't an overarching plot at all. Jinwoo has no goal in life, nor does any of the other main characters. The plot is for the most part caused by the state of people changing, and people deciding whether they want to fight people or not in response to this. If Kayden's injured, people want to fight him. etc. The moment an arc finishes, they'll introduce the next arc. It's very obvious when they do this and the new arc is often very disjoint from the prevous, but at least it's quick and there isn't filler. ** some love interest spoilers here** [characters] By me saying that the characters are likeable, it means that I don't hate them. I hate very few characters from this manwha except that one Bryan girl but she was intended to be hate-able. That being said, as mentioned, the characters have little depth. * Jinwoo has the personality of a golden retriever and is super happy all the time, he's really boring. The only thing he's ever affected by is when he convinces himself that he should have been able to do something in a fight that was totally out of his league, and does a training montage saying that he needs to get stronger, all determined like. He does this all the time. He also apologizes way too much for things that he should not be apologizing for, it's really annoying. Then people are constantly like, \"oh you're so considerate\". * Kayden is likeable enough, and is much less annoying than Jinwoo is. He tends to do the same kind of things and react to things in a predictable way, but at least his fights are entertaining. * Jiyoung is also really boring, but more boring than Jinwoo. She has the personality of an overpowered brick wall. She doesn't display any emotion and her dialogue is really boring. When hinted at a romance, I immediately rejected it saying that I didn't want it to happen, it just felt wrong. I wanted Iseul to happen since she was so much more interesting than freaking Jiyoung, but the author made it extremely clear that that wasn't going to happen. I since then never cared for Jinwoo's romance. Also I'm annoyed that everyone calls her so pretty when her character design isn't even that good. Can anyone in their right mind consider her a better looking than the freaking Bryan girl? Jiyoung's character looks so bad and bland in comparison. * Wooin is also a noodles loving brick wall, probably more boring than Jiyoung. His personality is his backstory. * I enjoy Jisuk and Subin, they're shenanigans are the most entertaining character interactions that happen. Though I can't forgive Subin for doing best girl dirty. * I'm a fan of Guestella. After the disappointment that was Jinwoo's romance, this is a breath of fresh air. Her character design is actually good and there's actual cute moments with her. * Generally the characters aren't very interesting or they have some single absurd quirk about them, which quite frankly doesn't make them that much more interesting, it just makes them unique. There is no character development beyond power scaling. You don't get to understand characters more, what they are at face value is for the most part who they are. Or at the very least, after a little bit, you figure out who they really are and they stick with that. Character motivations tend to be pretty bad or repetitive at least, tending to just go with \"I want revenge\", \"I want to fight you\", \"I want to get stronger\", \"I need to give my family a good look\", etc."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I tell all of my friends to read Eleceed and I will say the same to you who are reading this review. I stumbled upon Eleceed by chance when browsing new action webtoons online since I had just finished reading another story. When I started to read this webtoon it had about ~190 chapters published and I've been following it religiously every single week since then. I will now write a bit about the webtoon but my tip is to not read too many reviews / spoilers about it as it is the most fun to just experience it first hand :) It is a pretty common ... action story, but it is written in such a way that drags you in and absorbs you in the Eleceed universe. It follows Jiwoo who is the protagonist, he is a kind, humble and down-to-earth guy. There is also a second main character called Kayden, who is trapped in a body of a cat. Kayden is the opposite of Jiwoo, he is sarcastic and a maniac when it comes to fighting / accepting challenges. I previously read \"Girls of the Wild's\" which has the same artist (Kim Hye-Jin) and I really enjoyed the art. Eleceed is no different, the art is so nice. Every character has their own cool and unique design and the fighting scenes (especially in the later chapters) look so action packed, intense and cool. The drawings are colorful and easy to follow. Besides, some panels are so so funnily drawn. I have laughed countless of times when reading this webtoon. The character design is really nice and you can see development as the serie progresses. Each and every character feels unique, fresh and I really enjoy the dynamic between Jiwoo and Kayden. Besides the supporting characters are really really well written, they are funny, fresh and fit well with the story. There are a lot of other characters too but they are reappearing and no character feels unnecessary.

He is taught by one of the strongest people in the world, paired with being a genius, allowing him to progress incredibly fast. Typical plot. However, that's not where the strength of this manhwa lays. Its strong point is its characters. None of them are unique or groundbreaking but they are all pleasant and don't get boring, at least to me, even after 200 chapters of being together with them. The author has managed to make their appearance be an ... essential part of the story with cute and interesting dynamics between them, which again, don't seem to expire easily for me, despite considering myself quite well acquainted with these character archetypes. In this sense, the dynamic of the main cast is highly comparable, if not nearly identical to Noblesse's. If you enjoy it, you will also enjoy this. Now for the downs. You might have guessed from the opening but this isn't a new, fresh, groundbreaking concept, or one that refines, reinvents and revolutionizes a well-established pattern within this type of media. The story is very linear, with many cliches and similar plot points happening consequently, one after another. This makes it feel stiff and unoriginal, especially if you're reading this with the intention of finding a breakthrough piece of literature. However, for the casual reader, it is highly enjoyable, given that you attach yourself to the characters presented, the needed sense of progression will be obtained from their relationships and personalities slowly developing and changing. Though, that also comes to a stop for some characters after a certain point, given its long run-period. I could go on with things I disliked but I feel like they'd be personal nitpicks, therefore I'll leave it at that. Heads up, I am biased. I love Jiyoung so much I'd give this manhwa a 9/10. I will, however, refrain from that and be content with an overall 7, strictly for her, mainly her and the rest of the well-executed, simple, but enjoyable characters. I hope that when I pick this up again in a year or two there will be more romance. I have high expectations since it's been slowly progressing and getting screen-time, along with minor acknowledgements. Please don't disappoint.

The relationships and the character development are the main focus of this series. The world building is very beliavable, and makes a lot of sense. The characters are very, very likable, and the story is very lighthearted. Some scenes are very cute, others made laugh out loud, others made me really excited, and the emotional payback for some fights are very well build as well. The problem with this manhwa is its writing. There are many recycled story structures, and they repeat in streak. From now on, there will be ... light spoilers to the review: At the start, the story recycled is: criminal gets in town, kidnaps mc's friend, mc and other friends fight to save him. This happens two or three times. Then, there is a streak of academy 'championships'. First it is the Korean Academy, then the world academy. When this ends, the mc goes to the Villain Championship. There was a cat in the start, and it made a lot of sense: Kayden. Then, another cat joined the story, Kartein, but it doesn't make much sense. (Even though I really like the character) And now, a dog suddenly appeared, out of nowhere (and I'm also liking the character). The story is interesting, I really liked it. I really loved the characters, and it looks like the ending of the series is going to be good (I can't possibly know for sure now, since it looks like there will be maybe 200 more chapters), but the repetition of the story really kills a little bit of the pleasure. 8/10."}, {"score": "8", "content": "A very fun action series. I've sort of caught up with the updates (with a few chapts left) and I genuinely cannot find a second series that gives me the same experience. It's not the deepest or most thought-provoking manga, nor does it try to be, but it is very consistent with the things it does give you: that is character interactions & well drawn fight scenes. The basic premise of the show is Jiwoo discovered his power really late, when the more competent among his peers are almost always trained and raised in an environment tailor made for growth. This coupled with Jiwoo's teacher, who ... is infamous for both being sought after but refusing to take any pupils, got him into all sorts of trouble. Jiwoo grows remarkably fast and gains prestige as he fights his way out of whatever he got himself into, with Kayden cameoing in fight scenes pretty frequently. Jiwoo's a people magnet who accumulates prestigious people by existing. At first they make characters monologue about it, but eventually it just becomes a Jiwoo thing and the narrative stops trying its darnest to convince readers of it. So at this point you either buy it, or you don't. Personally...I think he's vague magnetism is being a bit too convenient as he collects the life long knowledge of goated power users like they're pokemons, but will I trade this for found family dynamics? Absolutely. Regarding his friend group: They're very fun to watch and behaves just like teenagers. If you're waiting for them to interact meaningfully about their trauma...unfortunately that's gonna have to wait until they are graced with their own arc, since Jiwoo is the only one afforded screentime for mental turmoil consistently. Other than that, they're really just chilling. Like sharing food, petting cats, etc. Jiwoo's powers: so this is something I really loved about this series. I think it was tacitly shown that Jiwoo's power is kinda sad next to stuff like literal gravity manipulation or elemental powers that can be made into weapons/shields/mobility tool/etc. I've encountered this 'protag's power's kinda disappointing' trope all too often but I think eleceed did it the best. Although Jiwoo accumulates powers, it's clear that they're all based on extremely intelligent use of his speed instead of him just 'getting' other stuff. It's even specifically said that kayden's really good at these sort of battle stuff, which is why Jiwoo got to be 'made' into whatever he had become. (As a comparison, black clover started with Asta basically just having a 'bonk' weapon that slowly involved into what was essentially dark magic manipulation, when the whole premise was how just having physical powers was a problem for him.) So: I think the power scaling here is pretty solid, though Jiwoo's tearing through the ranks a bit TOO quickly for the longevity of the series. Some criticisms: if you're a fan of ANYONE that's not Jiwoo's immediate friend group/his parental figures, then that kinda sucks for you. They disappear and occasionally cameos. And I don't just mean they don't show up often, cos minor characters barely appearing is 100% normal. I mean they get set up for obvious arcs that just don't. pay. off. Like Sucheon had his whole life uprooted and...idk, he's just back to normal? kind of? but just less of a threat but more like Jiwoo outgrew him? And Arthur had that whole thing with Duke (no spoilers) but he's just...kind of gone. I hope he comes back but who knows? I can live with minor characters getting crumbs but they are weirdly inconclusive. I don't think the characters really evolve with Jiwoo. They do improve but he outpaces them rapidly. Literally outgrew them like a game character levelling up & the opponents from earlier not even being a threat anymore. Which is...kind of boring in some ways. Anyway, do give this a try. It's a very fun read."}, {"score": "9", "content": "really good comic. characters are lovable, cats are well drawn, for a few years this was my favorite webtoon and i was begging everyone to read it. unfortunately, i had to drop the comic once they introduced characters of color and they all had grey skin. it completely took me out of the comic and i just couldn't read it anymore. also, the way the author wrote women rubbed me the wrong way. subin is fine because the joke is that she's not much of a girl, but the other female leads were all really quiet and i felt they had no interiority. especially the ... sister. i've read the author's previous works, and she was clearly just another emulation of his specific fetish for strong powerful women that could step on him. which, is nice, i just disliked how flat of a character she was. all she did was be strong and blush when jiwoo was in the room. other than that, it's a really good comic. characters are all distinct and really funny, the author has a gift for comedy and action scenes. the action scenes are really the highlight, and watching jiwoo grow as a character. a great battle and leveling comic. great comedy too. just not great in terms of diversity to a level i, personally, did not enjoy."}, {"score": "7", "content": "While at the beginning and mostly throughout I've enjoyed the story and characters, there is one aspect which I just can't stand in the storytelling, and it is the fact that whenever Jiwoo gets in a situation which he can't solve and needs saving, the cat teachers come and help him. I've not honestly seen any personal growth out of him for a long time now. If the saving had happened only once or twice I would understand, however, it happens pretty much at the end of every single arc. In the end I just see it as the author taking the opportunity from Jiwoo ... to grow by himself."}]}
{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/147448/After_School_Lessons_for_Unripe_Apples", "reviews": [{"score": "10", "content": "THIS MANHWA IS SO GOOD OK READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has some romance tropes but rather than it being the skeleton the story or characters are fleshed out around, it's more like just a nod in that direction. The characters very much act their age, and have unique personalities that the art also captures very well with their expressions. It's comedic and the romance is very pure (not 'sweet' I'd say, but genuine affection). The progression of their relationship is realistic, gradual, and above all very friendly which matches them because they're still young kids. Their immaturity shines through in their interests with boybands, getting embarrassed ... over nothing, awkward communication, and more. Some romance stories set in highschool have the kids acting completely out of their age group - or the story doesn't show them doing things like homework, chores, etc. But in this manhwa the presence of schoolwork looms over the characters and it's not as if they've abandoned their school duties just to make the plot more 'exciting'. All of the characters are so lovable (especially the main two) and the artstyle is super expressive, dynamic, and colorful. The author of cheese in the trap wrote it so yk it's good ok.. A cute slice of life to read!!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "This manhwa would be enjoyable for anyone who enjoys most slice-of-life content and overall the main characters are very refreshing conceptually, especially as a webcomic that involves itself in the genre of romance. I wouldn't have kept reading this far if I didn't see the very substantial amount of potential and care put into this narrative- though I do have some more mutual character development that I really wish to see. Characters: I see Mi-ae as very childish and occasionally immature, but she is also very curious, perceptive and reflective of her experiences. She's very interesting as a character, and she has a personality that most mainstream ... romances don't care to take advantage of. She has an obvious ego as well, but it is shown as a flaw and a somewhat of a plot device rather than anything specifically annoying. She does enjoy ridiculing Cheol any chance she gets. Her hobbies and motivations are consistent throughout the episodes. Cheol Kim is often irritated but quiet rather than cocky. He is calm and tries his best not to draw much attention to himself, but he is considerate of others around him. His dynamics fit perfectly into his experiences with the people who bother him at school and his behavior is not praised even though he is the main love interest. He doesn't get the unnecessary flashiness usually put into romance comics, and the way he responds to situations have very strong connections to his own past experiences rather than any specific trope. I also enjoy the way his backstory is presented in subtle but important ways as the story goes on to explain his behavior. His actual reasoning and responses to others is what makes him likeable and he doesn't have the narrative of \"only kind to the one they love\" trope for a character with his reputation- which in itself is gratifying. Their relationship: What I do enjoy about the main dynamic is that every action one of them takes has an effect on the overall narrative and their relationship. They do bicker during every episode, however these arguments have lasting impacts on their characters. Their progressions as friends are not rushed and make sense overall. I enjoy how their overall behavior matches up with their personalities well. I enjoy how small moments between them help shape their friendship. Mi-ae notices that he is willing to help her. He catches her when she falls (she's known to be clumsy) and helps her when she's scared or unsure of something. Cheol notices how Mi-ae is so willing to become his friend and that he should try to open up a little; he notices how she defends him and tries to help- at first by trying to hide their friendship- but also in telling everyone that she is friends with him and that she knows he is not the bully that everyone makes him out to be. I enjoy these scenes the most as their relationship continues. I also enjoy that scenes involving physical touch are not over-dramatized/romantized in the story and rather focuses on the experience overall. However, do I think these two would be good romantic partners? No. Not yet at least. The amount of misunderstandings within these 79 episodes is actually quite a lot and contributes to the fast pace of the overall comic. While I like that each one has reasoning and works through the plot, it's obvious that these two find each other a pain to be around very often or just really don't understand each other well. Mi-ae constantly talks over Cheol when he addresses something for the first time, and the two are interrupted on multiple occasions when they do talk seriously. She also has a sense of pride that prevents her from addressing some conflicts that she finds embarrassing, and sometimes she would prefer to be mad or upset at him rather than ask about it. Cheol also has difficulties opening up and explaining how he feels when they face conflicts which keeps Mi-ae from truly understanding his perspective. Here are some of the conflicts I do remember and are unresolved (not in exact order, but generally close): - the joke of \"Cheol and Mi-ae\" the singers and the fact that outside of these main characters, no one understands that they don't enjoy the teasing and this joke is pushed several times throughout these episodes and while it does help in introducing their personalities and dynamic, it gets stifling occasionally - several people throughout the story that ask if these two are dating or say these two are dating. While a few times work into the plot, there are many that are pulled into the main plot just seem unnecessary and repetitive - Mi-ae not having enough money to copy her papers and searching under the vending machine for coins, Cheol asks about this when he finds her but she never answers this - Mi-ae killing a roach for Cheol, knowing he is afraid of bugs, but he isnt grateful. She is upset by this (and it's not the most important conflict in their friendship, so i understand why it doesnt get a specific/full resolution) but neither of them address it - Cheol rejecting Mi-ae's request to study together (it is never completely resolved) - Mi-ae finding out he will accept presents from others but not from her, she is hurt because she doesnt think he thinks of her as a friend, but she doesnt confront him directly - Mi-ae rejecting Cheol's offer to help with homework even though she didn't do it at all and even though he finds out her homework isnt done he never finds out why she said rejected him - Mi-ae lying that she has done her homework more than once to him even though he just wants help her with it - Cheol finding out that Mi-ae was using insoles in her shoes. Mi-ae feels extremely embarrassed and avoids him for a few days (eventually resolved but was an important conflict) - Cheol believing that Mi-ae is doing homework for Jinseop and that he's taking advantage of her, however he never asks her this directly (however this one does get resolved later on but a sizable conflict during at least few episodes) - Mi-ae finding out that Cheol was following her and Jinseop around, she asks while and he never gives her an actual answer - Mi-ae not asking Cheol to help her with the dance even though she wants to, and then her rejecting him when he asks if she wants help (very similar to what happened when he offered to help her study) - Mi-ae finding Cheol ordering a nametag for her (he is unaware of her noticing) with some dialogue that she thinks he would find embarrassing if he found out she heard him. She tries multiple times trying to let him know and mock him, but she doesn't end up saying it and it fuels later misunderstandings - Cheol accidently removing his shirt in front of Mi-ae's window, when she catches him doing so accidentally he gets upset and calls her a pervert for multiple episodes. - Cheol and Mi-ae splashing each other with water, Mi-ae's shirt becomes transparent and while Cheol didn't realize that would happen, she starts calling him a pervert too for having seen this- mostly as revenge (i do think this is pretty funny actually) What is more irritating than the misunderstandings themselves (because I admit that a lot of them are creative and interesting and definitely work into their dynamic) is the way the characters react to them. They are constantly angry or upset (which does get exhausting after a while- no matter how fun the conflict is, and the fact that I binged these episodes could play a part in that) at each other for one misunderstanding or another but it's rare for them to communicate. While the misunderstandings themselves can be entertaining, the fact that a lot of them are unresolved or pile up between the two highlights the lack of communication. However, what I love about the plot is that the characters are negatively affected by the drama and jealousy between each other, meaning that what will likely get them to a healthy relationship is communication in the future. My favorite scene is the one time where Cheol opens up about how he's felt about their conflicts and Mi-ae explains her emotions/reasoning to Cheol without getting angry with him, in Episode 48. This conversation addresses certain conflicts, specifically the one with Mi-ae's shoe insoles (resolves this conflict), Cheol's shoe (not necessarily spoken about but not something that is a conflict between them), Mi-ae doing homework for Jinseop (not completely explained but I would say resolved), why Mi-ae wants to try playing soccer, and Mi-ae wanting to hangout with him and his friends. I hope to see her maturity show in the future, and the same with Cheol, as their relationship furthers. I think that maturity through communication is what will make this story a good one for me- considering that regardless they will likely end up being romantically involved in a way that's framed positively (considering the webtoon is considered \"school romance\". Art Style: The visual style of this comic is wonderful. I love the simplicity yet the way this artist is able to use exaggerated features and dynamic forms within their work. I love the way they show scenes of intimacy between the two without dramatizing the situation. The character designs of the two main characters are also really well done. They fit perfectly into their situation and have their own distinct styles. I find Mi-ae's overall look to be very refreshing against most webtoon manga art, including her eyebrows and the way her hair is styled. Cheol doesn't have as unique of a look, but he does have a style he also sticks to. His specific expressions fit his character well and it's refreshing to see when he snaps from his calm or generally angry demeanor in the face of pure panic when he notices any sort of insect. It's a surprising little thing about him, but it's consistent throughout the whole story. I actually enjoy this one, I have high hopes for it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "If you like realistic slice of life stories, goofy faces and a real slow burn, this is the one for you! I started After School Lessons for Unripe Apples to fill the hole that Cheese in the Trap left in my heart, and it doesn’t disappoint. The plot takes a while to unravel but it still manages to be engaging. The characters’ life as they go through their last year of middle school is believable and relatable, with undone homework, bad grades, not-so-understanding parents, and the late 90’s make a great background. The love story is not super central, this is first and foremost a story ... about friendship and growing up together! The author does a great job of pacing developments so that they make sense for a middle schooler too so we have fights and misunderstandings that simmer down fairly quickly 💫 I would definitely recommend ASLFUA to anyone and I’m sure if you pick this up you’ll binge read in a weekend 🙊"}, {"score": "10", "content": "I'm a HUGE fan of slowburn romance.

The side characters are built very intricately as well, all of them are given as much importance as Cheol and Mi-Ae in terms of character building and screen time. I just caught up with the story and found out the author has been on hiatus for a few months. I can't wait for ... it to be back because it left off at such a crucial moment. The story as it stands is a 10/10 for me. I hope it blows up someday because it deserves all the hype and some more.

{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/141120/The_Boxer", "reviews": [{"score": "9", "content": "Ji-Hoon Jeong, also known as JH and famous for being one of the most thought-provoking Korean webtoon authors around, has graced us with his most ambitious—and easily the most accomplished work to date, finally expanding his range from imaginative but borderline surrealistic dystopian parables to a more grounded, lived-in narrative setting. It feels almost cozy in comparison but aims for the same heights when it comes to writing quality. The Boxer tells the story of Yu, a silent, emotionless boxer whose intense mental trauma coming from a childhood of abuse has given him a savant-like ability to perceive time as if in a slow motion. Yu ... is trying to find the light that once spurred him to engage with the sport. Failing to find it, he is slowly consumed by the darkness as his coach is trying to shape him into an even more effective tool of destruction, devoid of weaknesses inherent to regular athletes. Who do you reckon will prevail in this bout? I've encountered some dark sports-themed comics in my life, and this one sure pulls no punches in terms of the sheer depth and variety of upsetting aspects. People die here and get hurt in more ways than one, and easily triggered readers will find some of the scenes very disturbing. Besides, this is not really a story about boxing per se any more than, say, Taiyo Matsumoto's Ping Pong is a story about table tennis; the sport setting is merely a canvas to explore social concepts and character psychology. It is certainly not a realistic take on boxing—nor is it intended to be one. Much like in his previous works The Horizon and Mosquito Wars, JH has a lot to say on the topics of abuse, trauma, war, ambition, love, human condition, power balance, parenting, growing up, and the meaning of life—and many of his takes are as biting as ever, if not outright depressive at times. Furthermore, much of this is told visually, leading to all sorts of powerful imagery. It is a great read but not an easy one. Thankfully, those who didn't get to fully enjoy his other stories because of the rather heavy-handed didacticism will, perhaps, find this one a lot more palatable thanks to the more grounded setting, developed plot structure, and a surprisingly lovable cast of characters which help put the author's social commentary and exercises in ethics into a far more relatable context. And just like in his previous works, the takeaway is, ultimately, uplifting—though you may only be able to reach it after having suffered a heartbreak or two along the way. Yu, the protagonist of the story, is by no means its hero. He is an empty husk, a vessel for his coach's ambition. A lost child who hasn't simply given up on the world—he doesn't even *know* the world to begin with, his mind all too haunted by his traumatic past. All the positive emotions and experiences we regular people have and take for granted in our daily lives are as good as alien concepts to him. In contrast, all the other boxers he encounters have unique, vibrant personalities that make Yu look even more like the unperson he is. But everything changes inside the ring. There, all these bright personalities with rich and interesting lives get to taste the same fear, despair, and helplessness as they realize their opponent might actually not be another human like them. Pity and compassion, pride and arrogance quickly give way to a single emotion: all-consuming terror. As he mechanically dismantles his opponents with surgical, lightning-fast strikes, and as he strips away their desires and dreams by crushing their will to fight back, Yu—and by extension, the audience—cannot help pondering why people box in the first place. Unburdened by worldly affairs, he approaches boxing from a place of deep existential enquiry. Is hitting other people fun? Can problems actually be solved with violence? What drives people to persevere in the face of defeat... furthermore, in the face of imminent death? They will eventually die anyway, so what's THEIR reason to stand up to it? What is Yu, himself, trying to accomplish in the ring? This seemingly one-sided attempt at a genuine communication, a desperate plight for meaning, produces no satisfying response. But the author doesn't need to throw around vacuous statements and vain attempts at profundity when he can simply put the audience square in the characters' head-space and give personal context to their actions—which is exactly what he does, to a wonderful effect. Yu's journey is one of redemption: not of his sins but of his own tucked-away humanity. It is a search for vulnerability required to reach and heal a deep-seated trauma. It is a quest of discovering unconditional love that is the key to the joy of life. It's a beautiful, touching character arc, but certainly not the only one you'll grow to love when reading The Boxer. The other boxers' bouts with Yu drive their own personal development, and even smaller characters get a surprising amount of depth in relatively little screen time in a testament to JH's efficiency in narrative delivery. After the main arc ends, the story loops around to the beginning to take a look at some of the other key characters introduced early on and recontextualize some of the themes and questions it raised, integrating a side-plot every bit as worthy as the main one into the complete package. The quirky, off-beat humor from Mosquito Wars also makes a return, and this time JH actually managed to avoid unwanted tonal whiplash. It serves as a welcome reprieve from the otherwise oppressively heavy atmosphere; a reprieve The Horizon sorely needed among all its doom and gloom, in my opinion. I think it's fair to say that The Boxer shows a delightful evolution of Ji-Hoon Jeong's writing, and it will rightfully take its place as one of the best \"non-sports\" sports drama around. It's a wild emotional ride with not one but TWO immensely satisfying, cathartic endings—that's two more than what you get on average! Absolutely do yourself a favor and read it; it is available in English on Naver Webtoons' website and app, and some of the pivotal chapters even have a very nice built-in soundtrack. I, for one, already cannot wait for the author's next work."}, {"score": "9", "content": "This is my first time writing review. The boxer is manhwa that has the same creator as The horizon.

One day he punch the bullies while being watched by one of the greatest boxing coach in the world and got scouted to be pro boxer.

And in this series every characters has a good backstory that make the readers really understand the character and their motive to do something be it good or bad.

I give it 8.5/10"}, {"score": "10", "content": "(Spoiler-free review) Verdict - The Boxer is a 10/10 Masterpiece. The Boxer is a magnificent depiction of not just the art of boxing, but the human struggle. After reading his other masterpiece, The Horizon, I was heavily interested in how one would translate from a apocalyptic dystopian survival horror to a sports webtoon about boxing. Needless to say I was not disappointed. The titular Yu is akin to One Punch Man's Saitama - extraordinarily overpowered. Many dream to be in his position, having the power to achieve greatness at the pinnacle of their craft. However, author Ji-Hoon delves deep into the human psyche, and shows the reader that ... a life without challenge is no life at all. While overwhelming power allows for complete and utter domination, it robs you of purpose and meaning - there is no victory without struggle. Rather than striving for the ultimate glory like the story of Hajime No Ippo, The Boxer strives to convey humankind's search for meaning, and the responsibilities associated with power. It should be noted that The Boxer is a seinen sports manga, dealing with adult issues such as abuse, trauma, suicide, and murder. The little sparks of joy and intimacy in the webtoon are worth savouring, and I as the reader sympathised deeply with each and every character. Many of the villains have motive; they are not simple one-dimensional evils, but rather, have been warped by society into monsters, which feeds the cycle of revenge and hatred through the medium of boxing. Much like The Horizon, The Boxer's art-style is absolutely stunning. Coloured panels encapsulate the horrific violence inside the ring, and elements of shounen hype when the reader is exposed to boxing techniques and power-ups are the icing on the cake. I would recommend this Webtoon to anyone with an appreciation for action and character development."}, {"score": "9", "content": "There is something about The Boxer that makes it truly fascinating. \"But what?\" I sometimes ask myself. \"What makes it so fascinating?\" The truth is, I'm not too sure myself. It's hard to describe. I could write about the story or the characters or the fights, but they are only a fraction of what makes The Boxer so great. There are so many things I love about The Boxer. I love how the author gives the side characters so much depth. I love how the story is predictable yet exciting. I love how each fight tells a story. A story about hatred, a story about ... hope, a story about obsession. I love how the author can make me feel certain emotions so strongly. Most of all, I love the fact that this manhwa always remained true to itself. It never tried to become something different. This manhwa was about boxing, and it always stayed that way. The Boxer was something I would often forget about. I'd read a few chapters and then forget about it for a while. But every time I came back, it felt special. I felt so many different emotions while reading this. Sometimes it was exciting, sometimes it was depressing, and sometimes it was brutal. And yes, some chapters were boring and felt like fillers. But the Boxer never stopped being fascinating in its own unique way. Yeah, it really is hard to describe. There are so many things I want to write about. But I have no idea how to write them.

Even the least interesting of the ... characters becomes interesting, he may be a secondary character, but still, he can steal the scene and leave you slack-jawed. The more you find out about the story and the further you go, everything that seemed insignificant or without understanding at first, makes it seem like something so meaningful and well explained to have the best understanding of what you thought was strange at first.

So I've developed this bad habit recently of starting random series that pique my interest for a volume or two just to get that dopamine dosage of starting a fresh new series. I thought it would be the same for The Boxer but I was somehow engrossed enough to read almost the entirety of the main storyline in less than a day. Like holy hell my pace hasn't been this fast for a manga/webtoon since BASTARD. The only other big boxing series I've experienced so far is Hajime no Ippo & Megalo Box, ... with the former being one of my all-time favorites. The Boxer, however, takes a distinct narrative approach, presenting a storyline that stands in stark contrast to the traditional underdog \"zero to hero\" journey frequently witnessed in sports-related series. Instead of a meek protagonist who steadily grows stronger, this webtoon offers an \"overdog\" narrative structure, with a significant portion of its content delving into the backstories of Yu's opponents/antagonists, allowing readers to perceive events from their perspectives rather than the protagonist's. This is because Yu for 90% of the webtoon is shrouded in mystery. An enigmatic powerhouse who can't be physically beaten. Yu possesses unparalleled strength and the uncanny ability to triumph over any adversary he encounters. Unlike many sports series where the protagonists experience both wins and losses, primarily for the sake of character development or to build suspense, The Boxer establishes early on that Yu will emerge victorious in every match, regardless of the obstacles presented, whether in the form of unconventional fighting styles, unimaginable efforts, sheer luck, or raw physical power rivaling his own. His inexorable dominance, shaped by his unique talent and the relentless conditioning imposed by his coach, K, a comically sinister and power-hungry war veteran, is both riveting and tragic to sit through. Why? Well, this constant string of victories raises an intriguing paradox – instead of wholeheartedly rooting for the protagonist, as in the case of Ippo, readers eventually find themselves yearning for Yu to experience defeat or, at the very least, a semblance of it. Well yes, seeing a strong character lose for the first time is enjoyable, it's more so that the recontextualization of Yu's manipulation by his coach provokes empathy, evoking a desire for his freedom from the world of boxing. The Boxer is not merely a tale of conquering the pugilistic world; it's a narrative of an apathetic, nihilistic, and emotionally broken tool learning to embrace love, companionship, and the intrinsic value of life. I'm actually still dumbfounded by how bingeable this was. I mean sure, while Ji-Hun Jeong's artistic talents shine through visual imagery, the boxing choreography itself appear relatively basic and occasionally uninspiring. I don't even think the guy researched much about Boxing beyond some basic youtube videos and Wikipedia articles. The most you'll see is some Dragon-Ball-tier flickers/swooshes, characters teleporting around the ring, and tons & tons of impact frames. Lots of negative space is used and the character designs are pretty basic for the most part, with Ji-Hun even remarking that Yu was easy & fun to draw because of his deadpan one-note expression and \"pew pew pew\" instant win matches. I honestly think the simplistic appeal to pathos and the structure does a lot of the heavy lifting here. It's all very straightforward, charming, and carries a lot of mass appeal. I also don't think the characters are anything to write home about either. Likeable for sure, but they don't really carry much substance beyond archetypal traits and one-note shticks. And being the author of The Horizon, there's of course a lot of monotonous & pretentious platitudes with a side of robotic dialogue. But instead of war (sans K), we have it on uhhhh the meaning of life because Yu is apathy and nihilism incarnate. All very corny and just doesn't mesh well outside of the final chapter of Yu's story. I'll give the author a break since I found his \"hiatus\" chapters showcasing his personality and response to feedback pretty wholesome. Plus his blatant & shameless references incorporated into his characters & character names + that shitpost with The Mohawk in chapter 75 actually made me audibly laugh, so good on him for that. But yeah....in conclusion, The Boxer provides a thoroughly enjoyable and uncomplicated reading experience. However, beyond the narrative structure and storytelling dynamics, it falls short in terms of substantive character writing; handwaving a lot of their development, and foundations surrounding the sport. The side story of Jay & Ryu ending off the webtoon was really cathartic tho."}, {"score": "9", "content": "what is the purpose of life? was the question in my mind while reading this. On the surface what looks like a manhwa about boxing, well it isnt. Though boxing is present there, this manhwua is much more than it. having read the pervious works of JH(the author) i was looking forward to this and it didnt disappoint. A dark manhwua with a bit of comedy to keep the readers entertained is what this manhwa is made of. story 9/10: YU being the main character. The story doesnt only revolves around him but the poeple he meets throught out his journey of finding \"LIGHT\" (the purpose ... of life). character 10/10 : Every character introduced by the author has their own backstory and purpose which just reflects the people around the world with each of them having a different journey of their own. art 9/10: The art is very simple but it stands out because of the simplicity of art which protrays a deep meaning in the manhwa i found the art more interesting. overall 9/10: A really high recommended manhwua but it youre only looking for a action (boxing) manhwua this isnt it but if you're looking for something more than that then just read it you're gonna love it. That being said i did find the answer to my question."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I have never written a review because I usually find that other reviews would be more helpful than mine. However, I cannot stay quiet about this series. I have had many anime and manga that I have thoroughly enjoyed but very, very few have legitimately changed my life and touched me in the way that the Boxer has. It transcends the sports genre and though it tackles themes in certain arcs that many sports manga/ manwha touch on (such as hard work vs. natural talent) those are not the themes of this manwha. This story is not about talented boxers beating each other half to ... death (though the fights are amazing). It's about life, what is the meaning of it, and if it matters after all. It's about following Yu, who is our extremely broken protagonist, as he endeavors to find meaning to his life and throughout the course of the story, seeing what gives others meaning in life. I don't think anything I have read has managed to make me as hype over a fight, as attached to the characters, or made my philosophize as much as this story. There are parts that are hilarious and parts that have moved me to tears. It honestly checks all the boxes. I never had one chapter where I wasn't invested and it constantly left me scrambling for the next one. But the best thing about the series, for me, is how I felt after reading the story in its entirety. After reading this, it has inspired me to live my life differently and see the world in a more nuanced way. I was moved to tears and I walked away from the Boxer feeling like I was a better person for having read it. This all comes from the author masterfully weaving together scenes so that every arc matters and all of it builds to a satisfying conclusion. Ultimately, I think that every person should read the Boxer. You might not be as touched as I was considering that we all come from different backgrounds and experiences. But even if the themes don't touch you, the character dynamics and the stellar plot will. I can honestly see no flaws with the Boxer. It's a masterpiece and I hope this will be the push to get more people to read it so that, hopefully, one of you will get even a tenth of my enjoyment while I read this."}, {"score": "10", "content": "so this is my first review, i chose the boxer to be my first because it has just ended on webtoon for people without fast pass, or at least the main story ended art 9/10 i really like the art, its simplistic for the most part, but when jh wants to have a really well drawn scene they make a really well drawn seen its stunning story 8/10 the main story is pretty simple, yu gets picked on bullied then one day injae one of our characters stands up for him, gets his shit rocked then Yu does the same to the people who beat up Injae, then ... becomes an unbeatable boxer characters 10/10 the characters is where the manga really shines, Yu who starts out as a character without real emotions slowly becomes more emotional with every match he has. and the side characters are all really well done, the best character being mohawk for obvious reasons. enjoyment 10/10 i really enjoyed this series from start to finish, it started pretty basic then turned into an amazing character drama that i really loved conclusion so basically i love the boxer, its an amazing story that had me on the edge of my seat for the last chapters with J.

This story is beautiful, and the fighting is also excellent. However, I believe the best part of the work is the characters and their development. I've even been moved by some of the characters' stories (the best being Yuto Takeda's story). The characters are very human, and their backstories are very well-written and fit the characters. Each has their own motives and ideals. And it's not a story where only the protagonist develops; all the characters are well-developed. The art is good, but if we compare it to other ... works, we'll see that it's simple, but still good. This is something that, for me, doesn't affect the experience of the work. I recommend this work to everyone reading this review. The Boxer is simply a 10/10 Masterpiece."}, {"score": "9", "content": "The Boxer webtoon is both dark and wholesome at the same time. For a series to combine two polar opposite elements is rare, but this webtoon does it to a degree to which it can be called genius.

Despite this, you cant help but root for him and hope that he too can have a normal ... happy life... His situation isn't relatable at all, but everyone of us has had the same thoughts as Yu at some point in our lives. All the characters are extremely well written and often relatable to an extent... The development is real and just doesnt happen in a matter of few panels...The author takes time to go into details of each and every character- Their pasts, their hardships, their sacrifices, their efforts... this will force you to feel stuff. This webtoon is absolutely ruthless in the sense that it speaks about the harsh realities of life and sticks to realistic narration...there are no miracles or superpowers... This isn't a fairytale in the least... It has a deep meaning... but at least there are happy endings?...this makes it somewhat wholesome. Although it speaks about hardships and struggles in life i wouldnt call it just dark themed... Don't think too much...

The boxer is a sport manwha that really kept me intrigued along the story, its made by the same author as The Horizon, so it has some dark and life questioning things. Story: 8/10 The story is something quite simple at the beginning, its about a boy named Yu, which is getting bullied at school, but he doesnt really care about it. One day, he meets a coach which is interested about him, about his senses and his talent.Yu decides to learn how to box, and ... he soon arrives in the boxing world where he meets new challenges to pass. I can say that the story is simple as a first view, but as the chapters appears, the story gets more and more interesting. Character: 9.5/10 I thought a lot about this story, and i think the strongest aspect about it its his characters, and not just the main characters, even the side characters are interesting enough to hype them. The main character is really cold, and doesnt show any emotions, its a good character, but he is not as important as some other characters which you will discover while reading. Another important character is his coach,he's a strategic and very smart guy, who has some purposes. Some characters that are interesting too are his friends, and his enemies, every enemy of his has a backstory, which is very helpful to understand every character. Art: 8.5/10 The art seems very simple, but as you read more and more you will discover some panels that are very badass and original.The artstyle is very similar to the art of The Horizon, because its made by the same author, so if you enjoyed The Horizon, you will really taste The Boxer's art. Enjoyment: 9/10 I started The Boxer like 6 months ago, and i read 30 chapters, and i kinda dropped because i forgot about it.But 1 month ago i saw some MMVS with The Boxer and it really got me hyped, and i decided to start reading it again,i dont regret that i started to read it again, and if you dropped it, give it another chance and finish it. Overall The Boxer for me its a very good story, where you can have fun, and also feel different emotions, if you watched Baki or read Weak Hero, i think you will like this type of story, so yeah, the boxer right now for me its a 9/10, i want to say sorry again for eventual mistakes, im not that good at english,but i really wanted to write about this story, it really deserves appreciation."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Beautiful, im fan of this serie for over a year and i reccomend it a 100% except if you are sentimental over some topics, might not be the best for u to see it, anyways lets summary: \"You've got the raw talent. Or you're the underdog. But do you have the heart? Do you have what it takes? Let's see what you're made of! The real fight starts now!\" Yu is our Mc that seems pretty bland if you didnt read fewer more chapters, but you discover his backstory little by little (if you want to see it go to chap 97-98) LITTLE SPOILERS HERE ... AND ON!!!!, the side characters do the job well, it might be a little repetitive for people that enjoy side characters because spoiler, they always loose with our mc. Lets make a little emphasis in the story, is one of the bad stuff in here, i dont mean its bad, its just common, how they managed to make it work so well even with some comedy parts here and there that you forget is some easy story to undestand, mc is strong, nobody can stop him, thats basically it. Art, a very good point here, if they make a live action it would never compare to the original piece, its just, very good job from the author, if you want to know more examples just search \"The boxer webtoon fights\" on google. Character, theres VERY NICE character development here, you might find K like a bastard but then we get his backstory and he seems more human, hes still a bastard tho, Yu slowly looses his sanity for K ambission, but that only makes better the serie (mohawk supremacy btw reference to the mohawk guy hes cool).

The protagonist Yu is depicted as an emotionally stunted husk with such exceptional talent that he is seen as a \"monster\" by those around him. Through Yu, the reader sees the struggles and aspirations of many character either come to life, wither away or completely change. What the author did with this manhwa is honestly breathtaking as it ties in the big question of \"What's the meaning of life?\" in a unique way through all the characters shown. Even characters such as K who was portrayed as the ... villain had his own beliefs, hopes, and dreams regardless of how people may feel: K pursued his goals because that's what he wanted. And honestly, who's to judge? We are all just living our life the best we know how. Finally, I love the humanization of the characters in the final chapter of the manhwa, especially with Yu who is seen at the end of his life as a shriveled old man who was once known as the strongest boxer. This juxtaposition from Yu in his earlier years truly humbles the reader showing them that death comes for all no matter who you may be you can't escape it. Monster, Genius, Average, or even below-average everyone has their goals and as is doing the best they can to achieve them. If you want a well-written story, with great characters, plot, and action I would highly recommend \"The Boxer\", and as such I will be giving this manhwa a 10/10."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Boxer.

Be warned. Story: The arc-by-arc story for The Boxer is very high quality. After being introduced to Yu and see his start in the boxing world, he very much becomes a secondary character, almost a force of nature. The story instead gets told primarily from the perspective of his latest boxing opponent as we learn their past, why they got into the sport, how they became who they are today and what led them to stand in the ring opposite to Yu, before he inevitably creams them. The overarching story with Yu deals heavily with abuse, depression, and a search for ... a meaning in life. This is where things can get a little off-putting, as the entire plot around Yu, K, and J is essentially a Christ (yes, as in Jesus Christ) allegory, with K being a stand-in for the devil and J being a stand-in for Jesus - as J sacrifices his life to save Yu. In and of itself this isn't an inherently bad thing, IP's like Narnia have told compelling stories with an overt-Christ allegory playing a central and prevalent role. The issue in The Boxer is that J is mostly missing from the story until the last 20% or so. Meaning they only reveal the religious overtones at the very end of the book. Additionally the author is no theologian and I don't get the sense they're deeply familiar with the philosophy they're discussing, resulting in the ending seeming very philosophically-hollow and taking an unexpected sharp turn. Art: The art is fantastic. It can be bright and vibrant in one page and dark and depressing the next. Like many Korean Manwha the series is also full colour which I'm sure many appreciate. Character: As stated in the story section, The Boxer fairly quickly abandons Yu as the protagonist in favour of it's several side characters, all of whom have plenty of life and are all very enjoyable. The weakest character in the novel is definitely K. The reason for this is because K is a character inextricably linked to his philosophy of life, a sort of social-Darwinism, and the author doesn't have the background to make the character seem intelligent or reasonable/sympathetic and instead he simply comes off as desperate and unhinged.This could very well be intentional by the author, as K is portrayed as the antithesis of J (who again, is Jesus) and so he may intentionally be an un-reasonable character. But I think it would have made his point come across better if K (the Devil) was shown to be charismatic until J (Jesus) showed the error of his ways. When the audience can immediately identify the issues with K's reasoning then J's role in the story becomes much less important. Enjoyment: Very enjoyable overall, with the last 5 or so chapters being weak due to the aforementioned issues. Overall: Overall The Boxer is very good and definitely worth a read. I'm not a religious person and the religious overtones at the end of the story really didn't bother me because the rest of the story was so well told. It's just a shame how the end of the story was implemented, as taking a more subtle approach or better execution in the same time-frame would have resulted in a better ending - and as many of us know the two most important parts of a series are the beginning and the ending, since they are what will draw you in and what leave a lasting impression respectively. Overall The Boxer is absolutely still worth a read, and still an incredible piece of art. 9/10"}, {"score": "10", "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so it might be a little congested and confusing to read. Hope I still get my point across tho :) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The boxer is not really about boxing. Yes, there is lots of boxing involved, but it's primarily used as a vessel to carry the themes of the story, ideas like effort, talent, strength, weakness, and power. These themes are interlaced throughout the story, adding weight to the narrative, and asking thought-provoking questions about the very nature of our struggles and hardships. Each character's motivations are explored fully, they all have a reason for stepping into the ring, a backstory, ... a past, something that drives them forward. The characters aren't just treated as shallow obstacles, but rather developed, given meaning and purpose. In fact, the only character that doesn't get this treatment is the main character. The main character is a natural genius, almost undefeatable, but he has little motivation or drive to box. In fact, his entire personality is empty, like something deep-rooted inside him is missing. The story isn't about whether the main character can overcome his opponents, but rather his journey to find purpose and meaning in his life, crossing paths with many other boxers, and seeing their own reason for boxing. However, even with how blank the main character is, the story never gets boring. All the other characters are given love and attention, which makes it engaging and emotional to read.

The art is very good, it uses common angles and the action is easibly understandble. The best thing regarding art about this webtoon is ... those few moments when it depicts the monster side of Yu and the scenery. The thing that i enjoyed the most and im not sure if ill be able to express how good it is are the characters and the development of the fights. From the very beginning each and everyone of Yu's opponents have been great. There have been conflicts where you respect the opposing fighters, others have been seen as despicable and you come to hate them, some of them were so charismatic and likeable that you could be cheering for them. In a separate paragraph i have to talk about Yu and K and their relationship, and after finishing the work, i do believe that it was well executed, although k is not as interesting as one would expect him to be. And his reasoning could seem as somewhat lacking, but all his actions are justified from his point of view which is more than enough. Finally, the journey Yu has gone through is incredible, without spoiling the ending i think that im satisfied with how every conflict has been resolved.

It focuses upon the lives of the boxers to show what shaped the way they fight and the talent that they possess, delving into the psychological analysis behind the different kinds of strength displayed by Yu and his various opponents. While it takes a bit to get to the complex characters it has great art and fights showing the monstrous talent of the protagonist. Yu is unlike most protagonists he talks very little and has few interests ... and lacks any real motivation for boxing, he just possesses nigh unrivalled God-given talent which allows the story to focus on other characters without it feeling inorganic as Yu feels more like the final boss than the protagonist. This concept is brilliant executed in the story and presents a struggle for the main character that isn’t beating tough opponents. It’s kinda like an inverse of Hajime no Ippo, but there are other characters who do follow the Ippo style of hard work but the author develops the psyche of these characters more than Hajime no Ippo does. Some of the art in this is jaw-droppingly good and brilliantly shows the state the characters are in and adds so much to Yu’s character. Overall, this is an unexpectedly deep and thought-provoking manhwa with some impeccable art and a really unique story and premise for a sports manhwa which is executed really well.

Next although the boxing aspect is great, i think what makes this manwha amazing is the stories of each of the characters, each of them have reasons they want to ... start boxing, or just have a beautifully written back story that defines there character. Next is Yuu, Yuu through out the manwha is amazingly written, although he is overpowered in boxing, almost as if he has super human abilities, i think this emphasises Yuu's lack of humanity that he lost. And Yuu is waiting or hoping for someone to help him regain his humanity. I also like the way they did the antagonist, its not a villain, that tries to kill Yuu or anything like that, but the antagonist or if you consider them an antagonist is a very interesting character like the rest of the cast.

The backstories are quite well done and they're all well-written. While the emotionless and terrible mental state of Yu is a core theme, it's hardly built upon, and is merely used a prop. Also the protagonist being extremely OP and his mind being such a black box sort of takes away from any suspense or impact the fight has. Also this is just a personal gripe but I really hate that K as a villain has no level of repercussions - it ... seems he just gets away with everything.

This alone makes it stand out from the rest of the sports, action manhwas.

(Backstory summarized) The main character (Yu) was someone who had lived a hellish life as a little boy. His mother was an entertainer and his father was a low level gangster. Their love did not last very long as the father became an alcoholic and constantly abused Yu and his mother. He became so used to the pain and suffering that he just stopped \"feeling\", he did not cry anymore. Yu was always stuck inside his \"home\" which was under ground and only accessible using a small crawl space. One day, when his mother is sleeping and father away, Yu decides to head out where he discovers a world he had not known outside his small box. He meets a lady who he becomes friends with as she gives him a tour around the area and hangs out with him. One day, she reveals to him that she has a terminal illness and would be dying soon. Yu comes home and is greeted by his crazed and lonely mother who curses him for leaving her. She strangles him and during the moment, he utters: \"What's my name\". The mother has a flashback to her as a child, getting beat by her parent. She regains her senses and cooks Yu instant ramen, she asks Yu how he liked the outside world and he tells her about his journey outside. The next day, Yu wakes up to find his mother dead, hanging inside the restroom. He looks at her dead body and hugs her by the legs, his father comes home and finds Yu next to his dead wife. He beats Yu as he asks \"Why can't you love me?\". Yu stabs his father with the knife that he had dropped on the floor. He takes his leave and takes a cat into his care as he leaves his home area and wanders.. This chain traumatic events led to Yu experiencing tachypsychia, a neurological condition that distorts ones perception of time. This allows him to become the boxer he is towards the beginning and end of the story. Sorry about bad formatting and probably some grammatical errors.

The existential concerns that are put and approached in a very simple way during ... the progression of the story is what makes this manhwa shine and be nice as a whole, especially because it revolves more about how hardships and fatality inherent to unfortunate lives (in general about the brevity of life too). It has tons of moments that feel repetitive, as the format of how it approaches characters and how the battles occur can get quite stale (the descriptions of it also drag), but fortunately it comfortably compensates due to the existential thematic i already highlighted as it having while being very heartfelt and breeming with sincerity (it can be a pretty comfortable read if you are already stressed and sad about your own suffering and about life).

Its unique blend of dark, emotional storytelling and masterful art makes it a captivating read from start to finish. The characters are crafted with such depth that they leave a lasting impression, and the manhwa goes far beyond being just a story about boxing. One of the standout elements of The Boxer is the hauntingly dark and sad backstories of its characters. The main character, Yu, has a chillingly tragic past that shapes his cold and detached demeanor in the ring. His journey is both heartbreaking and inspiring, making him one of the most ... memorable protagonists I've ever come across. Similarly, the story of the brothers Fabrizio and Marco is drenched in sorrow and sacrifice, perfectly showcasing the emotional weight that this manhwa carries. On the lighter side, the character Victor brings much-needed comic relief. He’s funny, likable, and his journey to becoming a world champion purely by luck is both hilarious and refreshing amidst the intense narrative. The inclusion of \"Gilbert Einstein,\" a fictional boxer inspired by Albert Einstein, is another surprising yet creative twist. His fight with Victor adds a touch of absurdity that somehow fits seamlessly into the story. The art in The Boxer is absolutely breathtaking. One of the most iconic moments is Jean-Pierre’s painting in chapter 26, created using the blood of a gangster. This scene is a perfect example of how the manhwa combines artistry with storytelling, leaving readers awestruck. The final match between Yu and J is a heart-wrenching battle filled with raw emotion and intensity. It’s a fight that not only defines the characters but also serves as the emotional climax of the story. The ending of the manhwa is warm and satisfying, tying up loose ends and leaving readers with a sense of closure. To top it all off, the spin-off series is just as incredible as the original. The story about Ryu and Jay adds more layers to the world of The Boxer and deepens our understanding of its characters. It’s a must-read for fans who want more of this exceptional universe. In conclusion, The Boxer is a masterpiece that excels in every aspect—story, characters, art, and emotion. It’s not just a manhwa about boxing; it’s a profound exploration of human struggles, triumphs, and the pursuit of purpose. Whether you’re a fan of sports dramas or not, this is a series that will leave an indelible mark on your heart."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I mean, wow. Webtoon Holyland.

If you want to read a manga/manwha that has a story with several incredible arcs (in which you will surely identify with one of them), well-written and inspiring characters and a beautiful message that will reflect the entire work from beginning ... to end, definitely \" The Boxer\" is for you. \"All the stars shine for you\""}, {"score": "9", "content": "\"The Boxer\" is a gripping and emotional manhwa that tells the story of a young man named Lee Han Gyeol who dreams of becoming a professional boxer. The series is written and illustrated by Jihoon Jung and was first serialized in Korea in 2016. One of the strengths of \"The Boxer\" is its portrayal of the struggles and sacrifices that come with pursuing a career in boxing. Han Gyeol is a character who faces numerous obstacles on his journey to becoming a pro boxer, from financial difficulties to injuries and personal setbacks. The story does an excellent job of highlighting the physical and mental toll that ... boxing takes on a fighter, and the highs and lows of competition are portrayed in a way that feels both realistic and engrossing. Another aspect of \"The Boxer\" that stands out is its character development. Han Gyeol is a deeply complex and flawed protagonist who makes mistakes and faces challenges that force him to grow and evolve over the course of the story. The supporting cast is also well fleshed-out, with each character having their own motivations and struggles that add depth and nuance to the narrative. The art style of \"The Boxer\" is also worth noting. Jung's illustrations are dynamic and detailed, capturing the raw energy and intensity of boxing matches while also conveying the emotional weight of the story's quieter moments. Overall, \"The Boxer\" is a compelling and well-crafted manhwa that will appeal to fans of sports stories, character-driven dramas, and emotional coming-of-age tales.

Having read and reread this story several times, I can confidently say that from the characters to the plot and even the art itself I have too few critiques to mention and far too many positives to write down in one sitting. While the action is definitely a strong selling point, in my opinion the greatest part of The Boxer is the characters themselves. There are very few, if any important characters that go without being properly and fleshed out in ... their backgrounds and motivations. This aspect makes the characters and the world of The Boxer itself feel that much more real and alive. When characters fight, it’s not just a clash of flashy characters, it’s a clash of two living, breathing people. While the overall plot of the story is generally pretty straight forward, with all the backstories and narratives that come with the characters, it becomes a deeply woven and interconnected narrative that leaves the reader hanging on every word. For those that don’t know, the author of The Boxer is the same author behind another one of my favourite works, The Horizon. Without going off topic, The Horizon is a story deeply reflective of its themes around life and death. Moving to The Boxer, the deeply written narrative around similar themes can be found. And while in a grandly different context, the themes of life, death, and the meaning of existence play a huge role in The Boxer as well. This is most reflective in the characters, who, alongside their backstories, each showcase a different perspectives on these themes through their interactions with each other and the main character, Yu. While at face value, The Boxer may seem like another story about an overpowered main character duking it out with a cast of flashy nobodies, in reality, it is a deeply emotional expression of life, death, and human relationships. It is through the mix of heart pounding action, hilarious interactions, depressing and hopeful backstories alike, that the author creates a powerful depiction of what it means to live."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Anyone who doesnt rate this as a 10 has serious brain damamge or is a literal speedreader, unironically one of the greatest pieces of art of all time maybe some people didnt get it and yes the epilogue is kinda weak but thats not part of the main story.

Rather than starting off with one of the heavy hitter kike Solo levelling, sink myself entirely into the depths with a series that somehow gripped me from the cover. I thought it'd be a high eight out of ten. The first chapter came and in all honesty it appeared quite interesting, following a re-incarnation plotline where the main character Cheongmyeong a great warrior dubbed the Blossoming Blade (ooh ooh he said it!) was reborn in a beggars body with the sect which power he consolidated now ... being reduced to a lowly financial and social position.Now Cheongmyeong must learn from the mistakes from his past and guide the new generation of his sect back into its previously wealthy and well respected position. Honestly an intriguing premise, there is a lot to explore especially with Cheongmyeong and perhaps his struggles with being a teacher or misunderstanding his students. But herein lies the problem. Cheongmyeong is always right in a roundabout way. Everything just works out most of the time due to pure luck (However in certain cases he does show a large amount of strategy) and a majority of the tie his successes don't feel earned. The story shows him working hard to become stronger, highlighting experience as the main factor which places him above his opponents, however this doesn't feel earned as he is never truly tested. Whenever Cheongmyeong encounters some difficulty he simply brute forces his way through the fight as easily as the last. I can't even call this aura farming bait because he doesn't have any. He would if he actually struggled but he never does. In all honesty i he ever lost a fight this would've ranked much higher but oh Kero Kami-Sama reading this made me feel like I was getting blue balled out of a good fight each chapter but there's never anyone strong enough to defeat the great and mighty Cheongmyeong. Despite this a way how the author could've woven a real fear of defeat into the narrative whilst still keeping Cheongmyeong as some overpowered glazed (harder than Shinobu's Mister donut donut glazed) paragon of epicness and coolness is via the side-cast. However I barely remember them past their base character quirks. You have guy who looks like Suguru Geto, Bargain bin Stark, prideful tsundere dude and woman who acts like Osaragi without any actual defining role other than being the only woman of importance in this series. I apologise for the references if you don't get them but thats the easiest way I can define them. It's currently 2:13 in the morning cut me some slack and I want to finish this and go to sleep. Also they're also overpowered compared to 95% of characters in the story. Maybe it would've got better if I didn't drop it, but really reading this when I could move on to better things made me kind of depressed.

It was fun at first, but seeing it happen for the 50th time gets old and it seems to be purposely overplayed ... now, while the world of this manwha feels so poorly built for something that is closer to 100 chapters. Feels like the storyboarders or writers were changed or they are busy engaged in other projects to condense their ideas this season because chapters are feeling much more aimless while padding out chapters using copied and pasted facial expressions. Generally for manwha titles, they always start out strong using well worn formulaic methologies borrowed from decades of manga publications, like solo leveling's cool loner+assassin+necromancer troupes with slight variations and hope the meshed product is a success but most of those tend to drop off by the 100 chapter mark.

It a creative and hilarious story with masterful action/ sect progression, and while doesn't do anything extremely unique for the first part, it sure as hell does it properly. It has a wide fanbase in korea, but western circles do not discuss it as much, in my observation. For me, it is one of the best murim manhwa out there, but I haven't really read another clear contender for first place just yet either. Characters 10/10 Not only does this manhwa embody the spirit of martial arts well, it also grounds the overpowered MC with such logical limiters and ... personality that despite his arrogance and severe lack of discipline I can see the legendary martial artist in him. Cheonmyeong is the character that carries this entire plot (quite literally). You will see what he does right, and what he might be doing wrong, and the writers give you substantial space for you to make these speculations and characters that are there to embody these speculations, (such as that one \"villain,\" given reasonable motivation to criticize Chenmyeong that comes in the later half of the pre-hiatus arc). The answer is mostly that he is very much in the right though and even if he isn't, the people can't do anything about it, which results in some pretty hilarious scenes. The comedy resulting from the character reactions to the MC is really top notch. Story 7/10 Now this is a rather straightforward story, but its depth comes from how clearly it executes the dynamics between sect members. Everyone's reaction to everyone is very reasonable, and in a genre plagued by contrivances (I read too much garbage manhwa to not point this out), this goes above and beyond in every aspect. In fact, its delightful simplicity makes it such a fun reread, as it still has details you can watch out for in the background, in the artwork, and in the small interactions between the characters. I have reread the first part of this manhwa (as of me writing this, it just began continuing publishing its second part) 3 times over and it got better through each read. In fact, the jump of quality between the 1st and the 2nd read through is amazing particularly because of how you know everything will play out. (Edit: After reading the LN, the story is more complex than I was able to pick up on in the manhwa, and this complexity is present in the manhwa too but because you cannot read the MCs inner thoughts consistently, you can easily overlook this. In the LN this is a story about trauma as well as sect building, but it is hard to convey with the webtoon style.) Art 9/10 The style is great-- everything is well-drawn and simple, but still detailed enough to be original. Every character is perfectly designed, and they have this incredible balance between under-designed and normally designed that you are shocked at how such a simple look to a character can seem so original and unique. Cheonmyeong just has a black ponytail and pink eyes as his defining features, yet he is so vividly imagined and distinct. Also the character expressions in this manhwa are just perfect, you must see them for yourself. Overall 9/10 Blossoming blade isn't perfect, obviously, as it sometimes drags on strange moments, and it is easy to differentiate between important characters and background characters and this can sometimes remove immersion (as literally the most relevant third grade disciples are the most non-generic looking ones and the rest are look like filler with small exceptions.) Sometimes, characters can have sudden mood changes. Yet these feel like nitpicks on the grand scheme of things. The scale of the world is limited for the first part, but it kind of makes sense as it is very much focused on Mount Hua and how it must be saved from the brink of collapse.

There’s no villain pushing him to his limits, no obstacle that demands genuine effort; he always seems to have all the answers. A little friction would go a long way toward keeping me invested. On top of that, the pace is glacial, even for this genre. Most chapters are filled with ... exposition that doesn’t advance the story in any meaningful way, so the few genuinely exciting moments only come once every 30 chapters or so.

Mahwa was killed by Cheongmyeong 100 years ago, probably rounded so give or take a couple of years Mahwa's Demon Sect attacked Mount Hua shortly after that, severely weakening the sect. meaning the Mount Hua Sect is probably ... already down on its luck safe to say the ensuing years following Mahwa's death. Zhongnan was unaffected or at the very least not to the extreme extent that Mount Hua had to suffer through Random old guy from Zhongnan said when he was a youngster Mount Hua was still superior than Zhongnan as a sect. Being generous lets say the guy is 80/90 years old and taking that he saw the downfall of Mount Hua when he was 10, meaning Mount Hua fell 20/30 years after the death of Mahwa, which logically and narratively makes zero damn sense. So either this guy is on his 100s or the in universe history needs a real good check up also how actually idiotic is the demon sect to only attack mount hua just because cheongmyeong had the final hit on mahwa, everyone is as responsible as mount hua as cheongmyeong is in that scenario"}, {"score": "9", "content": "It is one of the gratest of all time Story- Without any spoiler i want say story is well written.

Over the 3 days I've read Bastard, it has literally prevented me from doing revision as the story has just kept me glued to page after page, thinking that I'll finish reading at a certain time but ending up spending hours reading. The overall story is very simplistic yet very surreal, as the synopsis doesn't give away that much, I don't want to give away spoilers as to who the serial killer is but you find out straight away, so the action happens fast. ... This is why it was so good to read as nothing is meaningless for the progression of the story, everything has an effect on either the actions/development of the main character or the plot itself. The fact that it mixes in so many different genres that wouldn't normally be together, such as horror and romance makes the story even more interesting, as there are different aspects to the plot which keeps the story from getting tedious or boring. One moment the serial killer is up to no good, while at the same time the MC (Jin Seon) is having fun, which shows very different sides of people who are close to each other. The best points would be the suspense, the unpredictability of the story and the compelling interactions between the characters. These interactions are made better by the art, as it's all in colour, which helps to show vivid emotions on the characters' faces, whether it's sheer terror, embarrassment or complete sadness. So yeah I would definitely recommend Bastard to anyone who wants to have an enjoyable read!"}, {"score": "6", "content": "While writing this review I find myself in a position of affliction. Every limb of my literary body tears and rends its bones separate from the whole, in a combative wave of dissonance Bastard is wonderful. Bastard is awful. Bastard is ecstasy. Bastard is Bastard. I am here to set the record straight on this series. The most unfortunate and unnecessary problem with Bastard is its ever-present reliance on bad writing tricks and hypnotic acts dependent on the ignorance of the reader. Yet, the irony is that this utilization of plot conveniences and literary evasion grants the series a delectable dynamicsm that one cannot help ... but indulge in. To be conscious of the series flaws is by no means difficult. On the WebToon app, you can see via the comment forums that the audience is fully aware of its qualitative misgivings, but rather than criticize they hold a banquet of praise for its disregard of rationality and admiration of chaos. Indeed, it is a sinful indulgence, but an indulgence nonetheless. The writing is at times unbearably bad and thrives on concept alone. Any renowned writing aesthetic would find Bastard to be an impermissible display of lazy writing that must face every munch and nibble the critic enacts upon its weary neck. But do not misunderstand. Bastard remains a unique work of art that any reasonable folk who does not find himself obsessed with a conceited sense of the written word will enjoy. What I have learned from my years of digesting literature is that sublime writing is worthless if not founded on an engaging concept. It is the concept that interests us, it is the concept that drives the story, and it is the concept that infests our minds until our perceptive glances are no longer compelled by Earthly diversions, but the enchantment of phantasmal dreams. I can say with assurance that Bastard is a win in this department. Verdict: 6/10 Quick Summary: Bastard is an enjoyable thriller with poor and absurd writing that could be easily fixed. Yet, it is this use of the absurd that opens the gates to so many narrative pathways making it engaging and unpredictable. The four main characters are well developed and the end leaves the reader with a real sense of fulfillment. Although Bastard has many chapters they are structured with brevity and there are few pages and panels to observe. It is a quick and simple read, that any and all should have no difficulty reading."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Let me start this review by saying that I was just on the the final chapter of Bastard literally one minute ago and closed the MangaBlaze app only a few seconds ago. And now I'm here writing a review about it. So here goes. Story:10 Overall the story was Fantastic. If you used MangaBlaze to read this then you will have already read the word 'Horror' in the description. However there is much more to Bastard than the single word horror. Even if it was purely a horror it wasn't scary or freaky and the gore was quite mild (in my opinion). So don't go saying when ... you read the description \"Awww it's a horror story, looks like i'm not gonna read it\" etc, because it is not only a horror genre. The story is quite gripping and as each chapter goes by you want to read more and more of it until you become obsessed and don't want it to end. Well this is how I felt about it anyway. The plot takes place in Korea were a teenager is forced, by his dad, to commit murder. Well in fact his dad does the killing, he just lures in women and knocks out the victims with a hammer. The boy (Jin) has been doing this since he can remember so he just thinks it's natural. That is until he meets a girl in his class named Kyun. His dad starts targeting her, and as you probably suspect, he starts wanting to protect her. There is a lot more to the story however out of fear of spoilers I won't continue any further. Art:10 Now here's the interesting part. The art is very strange and unique and i've never seen it in any manga before. Nowadays manga is done on computers more often than by paper, so the pages have full colour. But the weird thing is the fact that the layout of the page is around two panels a page! This is definitely done for affect because of the dark themes that this series contains. However I can't help but think that this may also have been done to take up space for the lack of content. Probably not, and I hope not, but still i'm just putting it out there. The art is solid and at times may seem a little simplistic but that doesn't really matter due to the fact of it's outstanding story. Character:10 Well the characters in this series were great. They showed stunning emotion and were really unique. Sure Jin is the shy quite kid that we've seen countless anime/manga but he had his own personality and lack of common sense and knowledge which wade this series humorous at times. Jin really was an amazing character and I was rooting for him throughout his whole journey (except for the first few chapters when I thought he was a psychopathic mass murderer). Jin's dad was also an outstanding character. His two sided personality of crazy psycho killer and nice kind man were really strange though started to make more sense as the story goes on. Theres not much to talk about Kyun Yoon considering she's kind of the cliched anime girl, except she has a bit more personality. Enjoyment:10 Welp, from reading this review you probably get the picture. Overall:10 If you haven't read Bastard then go do it now, you won't regret anything."}, {"score": "6", "content": "At first, I must say that I really liked the manhwa and the characters (with special from Manny and Jin himself) and I had a good time reading it. However, I cannot ignore a factor that for me killed a large part of Bastard's score. The tutor's introductory death is a big problem. As much as Seon is powerful and influence is very necessary for an assassin, it doesn't change the fact that detectives could make the simple call that she disappeared under the tutelage of a private teacher and worked for the CEO. Therefore, the whole plot could have been discovered early on by the ... public. In addition, the investigative body could raise even more suspicions with Kim's report: she ended up being guilty of all 6 cases of disappearance, even though she committed only two. But if the tutor disappeared teaching classes at Seon's apartment, how the hell did Faye kill her then in the first place? Even more so if Jin recorded his phone calls, he would be able to actually arrest his own father without much of the characters dying in the process. But the score just doesn't drop too much in my view because the character construction is fantastic and Manny certainly stands out as an extremely intelligent character, well explored and developed in a wonderful way. It is a recommendable manhwa, after all."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Note: English is not my native language, I apologize for possible mistakes. What happiness! Bastard finally in MAL, I was hoping to see him here for a long time. I would have liked to review it just when I finished reading, but at that time the file was not here, and well I can say about this great Manhwa I suppose I could sum it up in something: You can not stop reading! Each chapter kept me in suspense and wanting more, I spent 2 days reading and reading ... I remember that I said I would only read about 10 chapters a day and without realizing ... I would arrive until 4 in the morning reading, this story was well done in the genre of suspense, mystery and murder, the synopsis of the story is simple and even the plot is really simple of a serial killer, but it was done in a way that catches the reader with each chapter. The most prominent point? the antagonist, I think that almost everyone who has read this Manhwa will agree on this and that is that our beloved serial killer, our beloved villain of this story, is not only Bastard's best, but I would venture or risk saying that is one of the best evil characters and antagonists I've had the pleasure to follow, one of the best villains traced in comics, manhwas or manga ... makes you hate it, love it, praise it, it's amazing if something made this story made me To continue and to continue without stopping was undoubtedly thanks to his antagonist. The art of drawing I liked a lot, joins very well to the atmosphere of suspense and darkness of the story, combining dark backgrounds and a somewhat dead coloring if you could say, but I really loved it, the best thing is that it is in color and that makes the expressions of the characters in many moments as well as situations feel or see more vivid. His other characters are also well made, the protagonist Jin Seon is the most one who evolves over the course of the series, maturing and going from being someone plunged and controlled by fear to a person who accepts their responsibility, looks at it in front and faces as we can see at the end, another character that I liked was his friend Manny Kim like the antagonist this is a character you can hate or love, sincerely you have the doubt of whether he was a friend or not in many senses, but I liked the character enough and suffered with him in a shocking moment for him in history. To finish this is a reading that I would recommend without any doubt to anyone who wants to have a nice time, its suspense, its history, its unpredictable moments I'm sure it will please the majority. Overall: 9/10 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Español-Spanish Que felicidad por fin subieron Bastard en MAL, estaba esperando verlo aquí desde hace tiempo. Me hubiera gustado reseñarla justo la termine pero en ese entonces no se encontraba la ficha aquí, y bueno que puedo decir de este gran Manhwa supongo que podría resumirlo en algo: !No puedes parar de leer! Cada capítulo te mantenía en suspenso y con ganas de mas, pase 2 días leyendo y leyendo...recuerdo que dije que solo leería unos 10 capítulos diarios y sin darme cuenta llegaba hasta las 4 de la madrugada leyendo, esta historia fue bien hecha en el género del suspenso, misterio y asesinato, la sinopsis de la historia es simple y hasta la trama es simple en realidad de un asesino en serie, pero se hizo de una manera que atrapa al lector con cada capítulo. ¿El punto más destacado? el antagonista, creo que casi todos los que han leído este Manhwa estarán de acuerdo en esto y es que nuestro querido asesino en serie, nuestro querido villano de esta historia no solo es lo mejor de Bastard si no que me aventuraría o arriesgaría a decir que es uno de los mejores personajes malvados y antagonistas que he tenido el placer de seguir, uno de los mejores villanos calcados en comics, manhwas o mangas...te hace odiarlo, quererlo, alabarlo, es increíble si algo hizo que esta historia me hiciera seguir y seguir sin parar sin duda fue gracias a su antagonista. Su arte de dibujo me gustó mucho, se une muy bien al ambiente de suspenso y oscuridad de la historia, combinando con fondos oscuros y un coloreado algo muerto si se podría decir, pero que realmente me encanto mucho, lo mejor es que se encuentra en color y eso hace que las expresiones de los personajes en muchos momentos así como las situaciones se sientan o vean más vividas. Sus demás personajes también son bien hechos, el protagonista Jin Seon es el que más evoluciona durante el transcurso de la serie, madurando y pasando de ser alguien sumido y controlado por el miedo a una persona que acepta su responsabilidad, la mira de frente y la enfrenta tal y como podemos ver al final, otro personaje que me gusto fue el de su amigo Manny Kim al igual que el antagonista este es un personaje que puedas odiar o amar, sinceramente te queda la duda de si era un amigo o no en muchos sentidos, pero el personaje me agrado bastante y sufrí con él en un momento impactante para el en la historia. Para terminar esta es una lectura que le recomendaría sin ninguna duda a cualquiera que quiera pasar un rato agradable, su suspenso, su historia, sus momentos impredecibles estoy seguro que le encantara a la mayoría. Overall: 9/10"}, {"score": "6", "content": "After some time of reading countless Manga,Comics or what the fuck you call them. I searched for something new, similar to how i discovered the Anime and Mango medium as a whole. I saw that there was a top list for the socalled \"Korean Mangos\" or \"Manhwa\" and while i normally don't trust MAL's top list, i started the top rated one Bastard and finished it in a relatively short time. Bastard has a simple premise, a father likes girls so much he wants to kill them and his son is his accomplice despite not wanting to be it he drags along since Jin (the Son) ... is afraid of his father. After yet another murder he gets punched to crap by a slave of the big bully of his school (Manny), he is a very weak boi, but is saved by a transfer student who he falls in love with, the problem here is that this transfer student named Kyun Yoon is the next target of Dongsoo (the father), and thus a very fast paced thriller,with interesting Characters and some silly plotholes is born. The police basicially doesn't care the first half of the story, since they kill at home it should be pretty obvious that the police would investigate the victims last place, but they for some reason don't even bother. Yet again this could be overlooked but the amount of plotholes and stupid plot convenient moments really showed over time, Dongsoo is following his son pretty god-damn often despite being a CEO in a big ass company and a famous murderer, he also has the ability to teleport everywhere. The Characters are, pretty well written and unlike most Manga they show rather Humen reactions to disturbing shit, yet while this is a good thing and also the trauma of Jin is again a good thing, the Characters sometimes overreact so much its just edgy and pretty dumb. The most problematic Character in the story is in my humble opinion Kyun, she got her own story but most of the time she is just used as a reminder that Jin has indeed something to loose. The art is no the best but the panel structure is great, the same panel with only slight differences to show Character reactions or to show that time passes in the story is great, yet while the Characters look pretty neat i found that the backgrounds looked...rather shit. Its hard to go into detail on the Characters/story without spoiling things so here... SPOILER WARING Ahhhh father-son relationships are wonderful, Bastard is basically that, a story about a rather complicated father-son relationship, i'll get to that later. While i found the Characters to be overall kinda well written I have a big chunk of complaints about them, Manny is the big bully of the school but later trains Jin to get stronger simply for the sake of his father. The back and forth of his Character was pretty nice to read, showing off as a bully but being \"friends\" with Jin after school, yet after he lost his legs and finds out that the only person to care about him is Jin and to some extend Kyun. Afterwords Jin tells him about his father and Manny therefore sends this black guy after him, he proofed that Dongsoo his a murderer but also that Jin is his accomplice,later the black guy discovered that he abused Jin and shouldve told Manny, if not it's dumb if yes It's pretty dumb that Manny still wants to avenge his family with Jin, he knew he got abused and that he was the only person to still care about him yet he wanted to smash his legs. Still this is the biggest Character/writing flaw with his Character and i still think he is to some extend well writtin. Jin and Dongsoo are different caliber, tho. Jin thought of Dongsoo as an enemy since his last memory before the accident that made him so weak is his father standing at the edge of the roof, he thinks that his father wanted to kill him if he is not useful anymore, later on he suddenly remembers (for plot conveniences of course), that he and his father killed for fun ever since he was young. He had the same \"Demon\" inside of him but through the accident he suppresed the so-called \"Demon\" and altered his memories, so he can blame it all on the bad daddy. That is of course a nice idea but evokes some problems, why would his dad if he cares so much for his son traumatize him, he knew that he is not the same as him but still. Some might say thats cause he is a psychopath, but no one is born a psychopath or at least not a mass murdering one, i wouldve loved some reasoning why Dongsoo killed all those woman but got none. At the end there is the end of the story, which i find rather problematic Jin forgave his father just because he remembered that in his childhood he had fun killing woman and Dongsoo starts chilling just because his Son forgave him, telling him everything. He kills himself knowing he has no \"beast\" as a Son, but if this is what he hoped for, why even try to traumatize the own son, why not trying to hide his killing and then knowing for sure that his son is safe. If we on the other had got more background childhood information on Dingsoon this could've made sense, but we got none, so this was rather odd and felt quite dumb, just for the sake of a happy end. My last major criticism would be the middle part, it just developed the completely obvious romance and got some development on both Jin and Kyun, yet about 2/3 through the story Kyun felt like a silly mary sue always doing the right, forgiving and underdeveloped Character, yet after the middle part arc she got a bit better developed. The female killer was, again, only used for the arc to develop Jin and Kyun, she had some kind of story wich felt rather superficial but still for what we got understandable, to some extent. END OF SPOILER Final Verdict/TLDR: 6.1/10 Its not the greatest thriller but it has enough heart to let me forgive some of the silly things. Very captivating with a little downfall of quality in the middle, it recovered fast enough and kept me engaged. Its ok to hate on it if you really can't stand the stupid moments but its also oki to love it if you can overlook some of its silly moments. I highly enjoyed this rather quick Korean thigy and would recommend it to everyone searching for a fast pace edgy thriller. If you wanna hate on the review pls go do so, i would love to hear some other opinions on the story, of course stay friendly. Thats all i had to say, stay healthy and kill your chicks you cheecky Bastard, have a nice day ;)"}, {"score": "10", "content": "You know those manhwa/manga that people say they just can't put down? Yeah, Bastard is exactly this. It starts off kinda normal, throws you into the crazy life of the main character, and proceeds to get better from there. The twists and turns in this manhwa are amazing and leave you shocked but you just want to read more of it because it's so interesting. That especially goes for the end of it. It makes us believe the same things the main character did and then surprises us with the actual truth. It doesn't leave you with an unsatisfying ending. All important questions are answered at ... the end and everything is clarified. There's little to no rushing with this series at all. The art matches the dark and psychological content. The color scheme is darker, limited, and more muted than a lot of other series which definitely adds to the atmosphere. The faces the characters make sometimes are pretty intense and maybe even chilling at times. The overall art style doesn't seem or look weird in my opinion. The characters are pretty good. Jin is a boy whose environment and way of living has clearly effected him in many ways. His actions are pretty understandable but he may shock the reader every once in a while. Kyun is a girl with more to her other than appearing to be usually happy. The character development is good. Also, most of the characters are pretty likable, especially Jin and Kyun. Manny, on the other hand, wasn't so much but he became a better character as the series went on.

Possibly because we spend so much time with our main three characters (Being the Mc, his love interest, and his father) I just want the story to stay with the main lane of where the story is going and not have any side plots. I’m amazed that I actually grew ... attached to the main characters and grew hatred for Seon Jin’s father since with most stories I can’t connect with them since their struggles are nowhere related to mine.

A Korean Comic with a simple plot synopsis that says, \"My dad is a serial killer\" (if you are reading on LINE WEBTOON). It sounded pretty cliche and non interesting after reading such a vague synopsis like that but then I still decided to give it a try and after few days of nonstop reading I can gladly say that it is the best manhwa I have ever read!!! Even simply reading the prologue will get you HOOKED on this work that you will even forget how simplistic and dull the art is. Yes, the art is as simplistic as it could ... to be, there is almost little to no detailing, but that isn't the strongest point of this work obviously. What makes Bastard are its characters, each and every one of them, they all exist in the webtoon for a purpose, neither once did I question the existence of any of them nor it felt like they were just added to give the story a meaning, no. What gave meaning to this masterpiece was the overwhelming emotions the characters display over the entire course of this comic. There is no boredom in any of the chapters, they are neither too fast nor too slow and the story progresses and the characters develop just at the right time to keep you mesmerized and intrigued. It's a masterpiece to me because it managed to DELIVER an emotionally overwhelming story because of the epic dialogues and the characters."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I do love to read on Webtoons a lot.

The art is near perfect in being able to convey the gravity and intensity that lingers in certain situations while also pulling off the light hearted moments with equal poise. ... The plot is meticulously constructed, arguably at an even par with (if not better) Monster. There is air of realism and authenticity in the plot and characters, that is quite hard to find in the medium of manga/comics these days. Sure it does falter here and there, and if you look close enough you can poke a few holes here and there but that would be just petty nitpicking. This webtoon is guaranteed to keep you at the edge of your seats almost all the time. There are hardly any mundane moments and it only gets better towards the end. If you are still reading stuff like Hokuto no shinken, Naruto, One piece or Dragon Ball and feel like your brain needs a breath of fresh air, do yourself a favor and read 'Bastard'.

It was an amazing ride from start to finish. It had comedy, romance, mystery, gore and thrill. It had me on the edge of my seat, so much so that I binged the entire series in a single sitting. Art (9/10): Don't be mistaken by just a 9. Even though its art may not be as good as the best, it is certainly good enough for this kind of story and the character expressions more than accurately capture what they're feeling. The backgrounds ... and settings are well drawn too. There isn't any too much side-by-side panelling, so it's easy to read even for those who are newcomers to reading manga or manhwa. Story (10/10): The premise and early chapters set you up for a potentially great read and the rest of the story delivers. There is a central story that runs throughout with events and actions of characters circling around. It is easy for this kind of story to get stagnant but, Bastard just keeps on moving and it never feels like the story isn't going anywhere. I have heard a person say that there are too many coincidences that happen that drive the plot. But I can recall only a couple. They still remain in the realm of possibility and could absolutely happen in real life. The others are actually driven by the characters themselves. Characters (10/10): Here is where Bastard's strength lies the most. The stakes are high for the characters and this keeps you invested in wondering what will happen next. The MC himself has been given a great personality of being weak yet brutal, clueless at times to cunning. This is perfectly complemented by the way he has been living his life. The characters have been given depth that explains why they are the way they are and why they do the things they do. We come to grow attached to them which only makes us more worried about what happens to them. Then, there's the villain of the story. He/She (no spoilers remember?) is one of the best villains I've come across in recent times. Cold, manipulative, calculative, obsessed. We don't know why he/she does the things he/she does. And that just adds to the mystery and tension. His/her ideologies are opposite to the MC's yet similar in certain ways. The former creates the MC's conflict with the villain while the latter creates the MC's conflict with himself. Overall, there aren't too many character relationships in the story, but the ones that are there are beautifully fleshed out enough. Overall (10/10): It is just a great read with a unique premise, characters and a story that help create a fantastic thriller of a manhwa."}, {"score": "4", "content": "At first this manhwa looked so appealing to me.

But what a hypocrite i am , to do this is like doing injustice to every manga but did anyone out there reading this ever consider being in the mc's shoes, the feels, the trauma after all,he's a human too show some mercy on the poor soul, yea we know you want to make this unique and unforgettable but the amount of people experiencing the shit in here is also in real life does any body know how they suffer? yea you don't cause you're not them and you think people don't ever experience the stuff mc experienced huh okay i will not name people but do you know how many homicides happen while the child is in awe, utter despair, feeling helpless of the parent doing a homicide in Asia, in USA , in Africa ring a bell?, not every parent is a happily wed adult. No wonder the divorce rates are high. Many murders don't get found out and many more does not even count as death rather they fabricate it with a lie, gone missing!!!. in many parts of the world and you think you are being updated on everything? okay let's not stretch this into a debate. The webtoon is just so good yet it ends so unrealistic. Well it's to satisfy the readers and to intrigue their minds not to lay the truth bare onto young minds. i still think this type of manga is to be made mostly not the rom- com stuff that make you more stupid. overall the manhwa is cat and mouse chase, as the chase becomes faster......the character is quick to do a mistake and fail....all the more realistic. no pretending , no escape you'll wonder how. Abuse, bullying, crime, mystery, murder, fear , sadness every element of a more brilliantly done story of a father and son. Take a shot at courage and be found. Defeat the evil and if you lose it's fine because you tried. Kindness is a lie. Love is brutal. Tears taste bitter. Don't lose your self. Don't give in to the desire. hope is still reachable. Enjoy the ride."}, {"score": "10", "content": "This has become one of my favorite manga/manhwa reads of all time, probably even the best i have ever read. i am usually a hypocrite when it comes to manhwa but i gave this a try and did not regret it in the slightest The story itself doesn't sound too unique but trust me, there are lots of twists and turns in extra information and background of each character but its not implemented in a bs way, no plot armor in this one. The story hits you emotionally almost every chapter. The art was really the only thing that wasn't spectacular, though that is not saying ... much as the art was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. The first change of artstyle instills fear into you and the way all the characters are drawn to represent the evil within them is one of the best i have seen. The only slight problem was that some of the character designs i disliked but it fitted the whole story and is really only personal opinion. The main character of the show can be a bit annoying at times but is not unbelievable, the background information for him really digs deep into his development throughout the manhwa. Just in general, the entire cast is amazing. ESPECIALLY the antagonist, the father. He is like kira yoshikage, but without killer queen but still double his awesomeness and smartness. He is one of the most well written villains ever. This manhwa is amazing, dont be a hypocrite like me at first and avoid it just because it isn't written by a slightly different asian or because the names are harder to pronounce or remember. You will not regret reading this."}, {"score": "9", "content": "This is a review where I will be as straightforward as I can. Bastard is something else, and I will explain why. I read this in a week and I found this one to be a kind of slow burner. Bastard starts off really tense, where you get to know a couple of things (no spoilers) that might stress you out or even keep you on edge. The main character, Jin, is an emo kid who is being bullied at school and he has problems with his father (serious problems) that he wants to clear. His relationship with his father made his life kind of ... miserable and he dies not havr any friends. Now, the story is great, but its not perfect. There is an intense atmosphere and vibe throughout the whole story, and also an immense of stress that you'll come across. The character art was really unique and it added to the emo feel. The ending was also pretty cool, and I definitely reccomend this manhwa for everyone. Go check it out."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I just finished reading and already decided to make this review. I loved the history of this webtoon, I liked it so much that I read it at once. About the story: It's a rather dark story so I recommend it only to those who have no problem with that. It's extremely engaging and you can get involved in a way that you don't want to stop reading until you know how to end it. About the characters: Awesome, this webtoon proves that you don't have to have a long plot to develop your characters well, but a good script. The webtoon is so good that you ... can identify with Jin even though he is the accomplice of a serial killer and has done various atrocities, and still hopes that in the end he will be happy and live happily with the girl. About the art: Beautiful, nothing to complain about. I recommend this webtoon to those who enjoy a darker-footprint story with a lot of drama and romance involved."}, {"score": "9", "content": "This was a really enjoyable read! This is gonna be a small review, with spoilers and critique to some ignorant readers. It is a unique story, I don't like romantic stories but Bastard had a really cute one. The main character was complex, and we would see that he is prepared to sacrifice and kill strangers to protect the one he loves. Father was one of the scariest things I ever saw in media, his intelligence and resolve, also how he can get inside humans minds to manipulate them, he is a monster. But in the end, in some morbid and strange way, we get the feeling ... that Father loved his son in some mess up way. I really like the character Manny, his story, from bully to friend of our main character was good. But when Manny become invalid and lost his family when he was calling for his friend, and the only one who shows was Jin, that moment was really emotional, yes it was predictable, but I was literally crying here. Art is kinda industrial, greedy, and colors really much the thone of the story. Bastard is a phenomenal story, but reading comments on some chapters, I was shocked by the ignorance of some readers. And those people call some things in the plot cheap writing, but yet those readers don't know anything about law in real life. Saying why they don't record father and submit his massage to the police. Please read the law, if you know it, you would know that record can't be evidence in court. And this is just an example of readers' ignorance. Creator of Manhwa knows the law and how it works, you can see that in \"Bastard\". There are some cheap tricks and plot points, but those things are overshadowed by a great story. Bastard is addictive, intents and it is not too predictable. Overall I gave it 9/10, I love it!"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Story:10 Overall the story was Fantastic. If you used MangaBlaze to read this then you will have already read the word 'Horror' in the description. However there is much more to Bastard than the single word horror. Even if it was purely a horror it wasn't scary or freaky and the gore was quite mild (in my opinion). So don't go saying when you read the description \"Awww it's a horror story, looks like i'm not gonna read it\" etc, because it is not only a horror genre. The story is quite gripping and as each chapter goes by you want to read more and more ... of it until you become obsessed and don't want it to end. Well this is how I felt about it anyway. The plot takes place in Korea were a teenager is forced, by his dad, to commit murder. Well in fact his dad does the killing, he just lures in women and knocks out the victims with a hammer. The boy (Jin) has been doing this since he can remember so he just thinks it's natural. That is until he meets a girl in his class named Kyun. His dad starts targeting her, and as you probably suspect, he starts wanting to protect her. There is a lot more to the story however out of fear of spoilers I won't continue any further. Art:10 Now here's the interesting part. The art is very strange and unique and i've never seen it in any manga before. Nowadays manga is done on computers more often than by paper, so the pages have full colour. But the weird thing is the fact that the layout of the page is around two panels a page! This is definitely done for affect because of the dark themes that this series contains. However I can't help but think that this may also have been done to take up space for the lack of content. Probably not, and I hope not, but still i'm just putting it out there. The art is solid and at times may seem a little simplistic but that doesn't really matter due to the fact of it's outstanding story. Character:10 Well the characters in this series were great. They showed stunning emotion and were really unique. Sure Jin is the shy quite kid that we've seen countless anime/manga but he had his own personality and lack of common sense and knowledge which wade this series humorous at times. Jin really was an amazing character and I was rooting for him throughout his whole journey (except for the first few chapters when I thought he was a psychopathic mass murderer). Jin's dad was also an outstanding character. His two sided personality of crazy psycho killer and nice kind man were really strange though started to make more sense as the story goes on.

Ok now he has put me off with CEOs now lol... Even though I didn't think romance should be in this type of manhwa, surprisingly Kyun wasn't that bad than your typical \"damsel in distress\" girl.

As a first, a good story with fulfilling end to it.

I was looking to read something romance, and well i found this. If that's what you want, you are in for a treat, the best moments for that romance, the right mood, the challenges necessary for it to start and to evolve are here. The state of mind of the ... characters had me impressed too, many of the situations in this, i couldn't swear that i would be capable of handling them myself. Being that the romance or the psychotic part of the story. The art was great, really helps this be the gem that it is. As for the girls compared to the guys portrayed here, well, no comparison actually. Like in real life some just have the strength to push on while others don't. I hope i have learned a lesson from this story actually, and that is, well bad things happen in life. And you have to push for that light at the end of the tunnel. As dark is the night, as bright is the day. Praising the one who wrote the story and the one who drew it all. Hard work pays off, and judging by the general score of it, it has been well received. So as a conclusion, it's a good story, nice art style, powerful plot twists and the general feeling that you get it's the right one.

Bye bye:))"}, {"score": "7", "content": "Not a bad read, but, at least in my eyes, with a somewhat disappointing end. Bastards main strength lies in the protagonists father. The Serial killer. You can very much relate to jin, his son, and the terror he feels towards his father. Not because of the gruesome murders, but because of the mental abuse. Dongsoo (the father) is an intelligent, cruel, manipulative monster that drives his victims insane. He keeps his son as a pet to assist him in his murders and uses his role as a father to lure in new victims and appear innocent to the public. He enjoys the security his approach ... has given him, as well as the power he holds over his son. When Jin (his son) now starts to rebel against him his father begins a cruel game. This is what gave the manga strength. This was done very, very well. Sadly in the end it seems the author could not find a way to lead this to a fitting conclusion. Instead he (or she?) decided to go with a character twisting final reveal that seemed to be more shocker than actual substance. This broke the dynamic that worked so well for this story. In the end this is an entertaining read that works based on the described relationship and the thrill it creates, sadly this is done at times with somewhat silly story developments. This would have been forgivable if the ending had landed, but sadly this was not the case.

Story: 6/10 Bastard, a Manhwa where the main character is a son and major accomplice to his father who eventually finds the wrongdoing in his ways by a girl in shocking financial situation... The Story is amazing and gets straight to the point with the father of the main character acting as the leading antagonist of Bastard, it's really hard to not find any ways to catch the murderer father if any of the characters used any piece of their intelligence in trying to record him exposing himself countless times throughout ... the Manhwa. Seeing as how Manny was greedy up to his last breath in trying to get his family justice and didn't think about his own predicament, he nor Mandeuk wouldn't have died - that and the entire loan shark group didn't need to die either if Manny just recorded the interrogation with Dongsoo. Overall, decent story but there are a lot of questionable scenes that could have led to a more satisfying ending instead of Dongsoo killing himself and Jin getting himself a sentence. Art: 7/10 Decent art style for a smaller title, they definitely don't waste effort when they are illustrating Dongsoo when he reveals his true self. Character: 8/10 As mentioned earlier, each character's convictions led them to avoid turning Dongsoo to the police which eventually led to their downfall. Jin had many chances to get evidence through spy cams, secret audio recorders with the money he possessed yet bothered to stand by idly - It was great that he managed his intent to kill because of Kyun but he only realized the wrong he did when she took a liking to him. Moreso of a hit-or-miss type of development in characters. Many twists in character development that were very surprising such as knowing Jin's mother was still 'alive' or Manny suspecting Jin of being the murderer's accomplice despite his friendly appearance to Kyun and Jin at the hospital.

Bastard has a solid plot that kept me engaged throughout. While many twists were predictable, a few scenes still managed to surprise me. It was entertaining enough that I finished it in a single day, though I wouldn’t read it again. The characters are decent but lack depth. Kyun stands out for her unreasonable decisions and sometimes frustrating behavior. Jin’s father, despite being a CEO, seems to have an unrealistic amount of free time to constantly monitor his son and coincidentally run into him and Kyun at random places. A particularly frustrating aspect was how Manny’s betrayal was brushed ... aside. Jin, and the story as a whole, completely ignored it, which felt unrealistic and left a bad moral aftertaste. The artwork is solid, though the caricature-like character designs, especially the exaggerated head shapes, initially distracted from the story’s serious tone. However, I appreciated how the art style adapted to the narrative, with looser and bolder strokes reflecting moments of insanity in certain characters. The ending, however, was disappointing for several reasons. Jin’s sudden decision to forgive his father for years of psychological torment felt rushed and unearned. The story also trivializes the father’s cruelty, making his crimes seem almost excusable. Additionally, the unresolved question of Jin’s mother’s supposed death lingers throughout the story, only for her unexpected return at the end to feel like a cheap twist rather than a well-crafted resolution. Despite its flaws, Bastard is an entertaining read that I’d recommend to fans of suspense or drama, provided you don’t mind some gory scenes and a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Anyone who loves psychological thriller and horror tags should give this manhwa a read.

Of course, this does not diminish its superb overall quality, which can entertain both casual and “formal” manhwa fans. In fact, I originally thought it was a masterpiece without fully understanding why. Now, having undergone a bit more formal education in literary analysis, I decided to reread it since I had forgotten most of it but still remembered its greatness. So, should you read Bastard? Absolutely, if you ... enjoy thrillers, dramas, or even romances. The romance subplot carries enough weight to make the journey entertaining. It is not the typical romance you would find in a trivial and “happy” setting. Rather, it is a romance found in extremely dire circumstances. The contrast between the moments of intimate happiness and the terrible external conditions is what makes the romance satisfying to observe. Indeed, we learn to see that, even in horrible situations, there exist sources of true happiness and hope, one of which is romantic love. Friendship, another kind of love, is also explored in Bastard as fundamental support for people in critical conditions. While I will not further analyze these themes on their own and their relation to self-improvement, I will later relate these to one’s ability to break free from their unhealthy mania with social standing and, by extension, its norms. Light spoilers ahead What is Bastard about? On the surface, it is about a 17-year-old boy named Jin Seon who reluctantly works in collusion with his father, a serial murderer. Importantly, Jin is physically weak and socially awkward, making him friendless and a victim of bullying. The story takes off when he almost dies at the hands of Beau Park, the underling of Manny Kim, a bully. However, he is saved by Kyun Yoon, a transfer student. His father sees her and decides that she will be the next victim of his murderous spree. Although he cannot disobey his father due to his trauma, he does not want Kyun to be murdered and tries his best to resolve this situation without reporting to the police, as he has been an accomplice in the murders. This conflict serves as the overarching plot point throughout the story. Of course, many other conflicts arise later. In many of these struggles, we can attribute an assortment of motives to them. Yet, upon closer analysis, we see that most of these motives derive from an irrational fixation on the characters’ perceptions of themselves relative to others. What would make them look good in front of others? Can they not determine what is good on their own terms? To what extent would they try to attain a good perception from others, even if it required a sacrifice of important values? Such are the questions that this manhwa explores. This compulsion to look good in front of others can worsen to such a degree that it can lead to a perversion of this obsession, where the one unable to attain a certain self-ascribed social status seeks revenge on others who can, instead of trying to find their own happiness on their own terms. Bastard shows that we, humans, have an increasing tendency to achieve a higher social ranking relative to others as a means of success and personal happiness, even if it is destructive. This tendency can end up opposing and dominating other personal values if not handled carefully. The ability to break free from this ultimately falls on the shoulders of the individual, who may seek powerful tools to do so, such as friendship or love. This is not to say that we should not care about social standards and fully embrace our own selves (society would not function otherwise). Instead, we should rethink and challenge such standards and perceptions to overcome self-destructive behaviours induced by these ideas. Heavy spoilers ahead Whether it is in subtle or explicit ways, all characters in Bastard exhibit much care for their social perceptions. It is only after they challenge such perceptions that they truly develop for the better. To demonstrate this idea, I will go through each relevant character and their respective development throughout the manhwa. Jin Seon (the protagonist): Having gone through isolation, abuse and trauma, Jin does not have much understanding of the outside world or its norms, nor does he care much about these. We could say he is beyond the point of such trivialities, but one major component stops him in his tracks from doing what is right. He cares deeply about Kyun’s perception of him. Indeed, his motivation throughout the entire manhwa not to report to the police stems from the fact that he would have to turn himself in as an accomplice. Initially, Jin had contemplations about reporting to the police, but he soon had a strong conviction not to since he was terrified of how Kyun, his love interest, would perceive him. Up until the last second, he goes so far as to lie and almost create another murder victim to maintain a position of secrecy. Only when exposed, without any possibility to escape, does Jin finally confess the wrongdoings to Kyun in order to keep her safe, as he loves her. It is at this point that he directly faces his past and accepts responsibility. Instead of becoming like his father, a person with cruel tendencies, or worrying about Kyun’s image of him, he changes and is able to act explicitly on what he thinks is good (i.e. confess to Kyun and the police and forgive his father for his own misconception of the past). Kyun Yoon (the friend): Initially, a friend who saved Jin when he was bullied, she quickly sparks an interest in Jin, who has been in a dark world of his own. Shortly after meeting Jin, she assumes that he is the typical rich, spoiled kid. However, upon learning more about him and his sufferings, she warms to him and their friendship develops into a romance. An interesting thing to see here is that despite Kyun’s lower social and economic status, she still clings to civilized society as it is. She has not given up and fallen into depravity (she nearly does so, but ends up finding a legal job). In contrast, Jin shows no care for society or its social norms. He has fully given up on following the civilized path as he seeks violent revenge on his father. Their pairing works perfectly in such a way that Kyun brings back sense and civility to Jin while Jin allows Kyun to learn and rethink society and its norms. For instance, for most of the story, she assumed Jin, like any normal person, should go back home and patch his relationship with his father by talking it out. She could not conjure up reasons as to why Jin could not go back home. Moreover, on many occasions, she felt as though she was breaking norms, in a pejorative sense, by letting Jin sleep at her house. She could not sustain a social behaviour that would break norms. It is through Jin that she starts to become more open-minded about the world. Manny Kim (the bully or the “lion”): While he first gave off the impression of the typical bully we would see in a school setting, we soon learn that something else pressures him into behaving the way he does. Although he is definitely at fault for giving in to bullying others, we see that he very much values his social image of power to the point of hiding his friendship with Jin, a weakling. Bastard uses the analogy of the law of the jungle to display the power dynamics of the bullies. In this analogy, Manny is the lion to display his inherent status of power. He, simply, by nature, must be seen as the apex. He must hold the top rank, but at what cost? True to this analogy, Manny avoids displaying signs of weakness, such as being friends with the weakest of the weak. As we are shown, this “ecosystem” is dangerous as it provides no place for the weak, even though we are all of the same species, who thrive in being social. It harms and destroys friendships as it values social status over friendship. There is no loyalty in such a system, which highlights strength above all. Success is based on dominating others. Thus, the main factor of Manny’s character development lies in his inner ability or inability to break free from the powerful social image he proudly holds to maintain his friendship with a true friend, Jin. It is only after getting into an accident and losing all his stature due to his permanent disability that he is able to let go of the “jungle” dynamic and truly care for Jin. While it is significant for Manny to express less investment in social status to care for a friend, it is also important for him to maintain order and civility, which he does as he does not kill Jin’s father in the end. All in all, his character emphasizes the theme of the balance needed to rethink and challenge social systems while not fully disregarding them, since many are present for good reasons. Beau Park (the bully’s underling or the “hyena”): Beau Park is a minor character in Bastard, yet he remains an interesting character as he represents a path Jin could have taken if he cared to follow the social systems in his school. In the jungle analogy, he is the hyena, or the cunning and devious being. Trapped in this ecosystem, to survive, he has to be sly, which results in him paying his bullies to exert some social power, avoid their attacks, and bully weaker people like Jin. Once again, Bastard displays that loyalty is worthless in this schema. The moment he feels that Manny has been favouring Jin too much, which means he is seen as weaker, he turns on him and joins another gang to take revenge. He simply cannot bear his weakness relative to others, so he must express artificial strength over others, no matter the cost, instead of freeing himself from such trivial social constructs weighing down his self-image. Faye Kim (the convenience store worker): This character embodies what happens when a “weak” person cannot bear their own weakness and thrives off comparing themself to others to an extreme degree. Just as Beau Park is imprisoned by his mind, where his self-vindication and success rely on surpassing other people, so is Faye Kim. We could say the same about Manny’s initial character, but he soon realizes he does not need any vindication from others as he becomes more protective of Jin, his friend, even if it hurts him socially (before the accident) and physically (after the accident). Faye, the second murderer, is a much more extreme version of Beau Park, who has turned to a perverse version of obsessing over social status. As was written previously, Faye, unable to attain her ideal version of beauty, feels unsuccessful in life compared to others who can. As such, incapable of bearing her own self-assigned lesser beauty relative to others, she murders those with higher beauty out of resentment. Dong-Soo Seon (the protagonist’s father): Unlike Faye, who murders out of resentment, this character does so for a much more inexplicable, yet deeper reason rooted in psychopathy. This is evidenced by his lack of empathy, conscience and regret, accompanied by his joy and thrill of doing this activity as a father-son bond. Even though he seemingly shows zero care for his serial killing, he displays immense concern for his public image and reputation as the leader of a top company, which is explicitly stated by Jin. This shows that even the most vile of people are consumed by the success gained in prevailing over others. Conclusion Bastard is a manhwa you should absolutely read, at a proper pace to carefully observe what I have just described and a lot more that I have not. Just like its title implies, it is about an “illegitimate” child, born outside social norms, and his battle against his inner self to challenge social perceptions, understand what is right, and come back to civilization."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Bastard is a gripping coming-of-age tale complete with revenge, trauma and violence. Story 9/10 High school protagonist Jin has been raised by a serial killer, who forces him to partake in gratuitous acts of violence. The implications of this are enormous, and as Jin struggles to find his identity, he falls in love and his world changes. His moral struggles are a prevalent theme in the webtoon, and reading an adolescent deal with serial killers, bullies, and murderers whilst growing up is a sight to behold. The number of plot twists and insane situations are what kept me interested, though as a complete story there leaves a ... lot to be desired. Art 7/10 The artwork in this webtoon has a simple, clean style, but nothing special or amazing. Nonetheless, it does the job, and many panels do convey the horror of the events that unfold. However, a lot of it is comical and over-exaggerated. Character 7/10 The characters in this story both make and break it. The author is certainly a master in developing characters and making the reader empathise with them, but sometimes it is hard to suspend disbelief for some of the events that unfold. This is to say that, in a real life scenario, it is entirely inaccurate and unfeasible for the events to occur in such a way - and as such, the characters' reactions. I would describe this webtoon as seinen content with shounen protagonists, a lot of which is carried by the shock value. Overall 9/10 Regardless, this was an enjoyable binge-read and I do recommend it to those who enjoy murder thrillers/horror. It does not leave a lasting impact, but it does provide many heated and exciting moments which carry the story well."}, {"score": "8", "content": "This was my first contact with a Manhwa. The way of reading it is very good and simple! About the story: I enjoyed this Manhwa, the author managed to maintain suspense and mysteries until the end, to the point that nothing prepares you for the plot twist in the first few chapters. Therefore, I recommend that you don't read the synopsis if you're interested in reading this Manhwa, just go straight to reading it. Now, spoiler moment! The characters are very interesting, both Kyun, Jin, Manny... The father is a good character to the point of being detestable throughout the story, and that's a positive point. Many authors ... who work with this type of story end up \"romanticizing\" the killer, even indirectly. But I didn't feel that in this Manhwa, not until the end at least... The fight between Jin and his father and how all the other characters become connected to the plot is very interesting, and how clever Jin's father is, in a way that irritates any reader because all you want is for the truth to be revealed lol Now, the ending was a bit confusing for me, I can't say if I ended up interpreting it wrong, but I found the idea that Jin's father always cared about him a bit forced... but is that really it? Because at one point, before Jin's father kills Manny, Manny says he's going to do the same thing to Jin and turn him over to the police as an accomplice, and then comes the question, did the father say he messed up because he got too angry about that? Because Manny found out their secret, or as a way to protect his son? I got confused at this part but interpreted it as if he was somehow \"protecting\" Jin... but it seemed too forced to happen right at the end, so I didn't like it... Besides all the idea that Jin as a child enjoyed helping his father commit crimes, when in fact he was clearly manipulated since he was a child, especially being a child, Jin when he was little said he found it fun and that he was just playing with his father... but to me, it seems like a mistreated and manipulated child by his father to act like him, after all, when we are little we follow our parents' footsteps. So this little gap that the story gave to say that he \"liked\" to help his father in crimes seemed a bit out of context to me, but again I may have interpreted it wrong. If anyone has a different opinion and wants to present it, I would like to know. However, aside from these two moments, the end of the work was very good, seeing Jin rising from the pit, admitting his mistakes, and going in the opposite direction of his father, to the point of forgiving him, was very interesting. This shows how Jin evolved and how he is not a killer nor does he want to follow his father's footsteps (something that Jin's father himself and the astral form of his mother discuss on the rooftop before Jin's father jumps off the building). Seeing him serving his sentence and meanwhile knowing that outside he has a good and happy life finally waiting for him was a cool ending that leaves a lot for readers to think about. Jin managed to defeat the demon and end it. ---------------- Pt/Br Esse foi o primeiro contato que eu tive com um Manhwa. A forma de ler é muito boa e simples! Sobre a história: Eu gostei desse manhwa, o autor conseguiu manter o suspense e os mistérios até o fim, ao ponto de que nada te prepara para o plot twist dos primeiros capítulos. Por isso, recomendo que você não leia a sinopse caso esteja interessado em ler esse manhwa, apenas vá direto para a leitura. Agora o momento com spoilers! Os personagens são muito interessantes, tanto a kyun, como o jin, o manny... O pai é um bom personagem a ponto de ser detestável durante toda a história, e isso é um ponto positivo. Muitos autores que trabalham com esse tipo de história acabam por \"romantizar\" o assassino, mesmo que de forma indireta. Mas não senti isso nesse manhwa, não até o final pelo menos... A luta entre Jin e seu pai e como todos os outros personagens vão se conectando a trama é muito interessante, e o quão esperto o pai de Jin é, de uma forma que irrita qualquer leitor, pois tudo que você quer é que a verdade seja esclarecida lol Agora, o final foi um pouco confuso para mim, não sei dizer se acabei interpretando de forma errada, mas eu achei meio forçado a ideia de que o pai do Jin sempre se importava com ele... mas será que é isso mesmo? Pois em certo momento, antes do pai de Jin matar o Manny, Manny diz que vai fazer a mesma coisa com o Jin e entrega-lo para policia como cúmplice, e aí vem a questão, o pai diz que fez besteira por ter ficado muito irritado com isso, mas com o que exatamente? Com o fato de que Manny descobriu o segredo dos dois, ou por uma forma de proteção ao seu filho? Eu fiquei confuso nessa parte mas interpretei como se ele estivesse de certo modo \"protegendo\" o Jin... mas isso pareceu muito forçado para acontecer logo no final, então eu não gostei... Além de toda a ideia de que o Jin como uma criança ter gostado de ajudar o pai a cometer os crimes, quando na verdade ele foi claramente manipulado desde pequeno, ainda mais se tratando de uma criança, Jin quando era pequeno dizia achar divertido e que estava apenas brincando com seu pai... mas para mim, enxergo como uma criança maltratada e manipulada pelo pai a agir da forma dele, afina, quando somos pequenos nós seguimos os passos dos nossos pais. Então essa pequena brecha que a história deu para dizer que ele \"gostava\" de ajudar o pai nos crimes me pareceu um pouco fora do contexto, mas novamente posso ter interpretado errado. Caso alguém tenha uma opinião diferente e quiser me apresentar, adoraria saber. Porém tirando esses dois momentos o final da obra foi muito bom, ver o Jin se levantando do poço, admitindo seus erros e indo na direção contrária do seu pai, a ponto de perdoa-lo, foi bem interessante. Isso mostra como o Jin evoluiu e como ele não é um assassino muito menos deseja seguir os passos do pai (algo que o próprio pai e a forma astral de sua mãe conversam no telhado antes do pai do Jin pular do prédio). Ver ele cumprindo com a pena dele e enquanto isso saber que la fora ele tem uma vida boa e feliz finalmente o aguardando foi um final legal que deixa aberto muita coisa para os leitores pensarem. Jin conseguiu vencer o demonio e acabar com ele."}, {"score": "6", "content": "The story is pretty straight forward. The main draw is the antagonist and how untouchable he is. The art is acceptable but the paneling is atrocious. For the most part I enjoyed Jin, Kyun, and especially Manny. Following Jin's story and having him be gaslit from start to finish makes this a pretty miserable read. Jin never got the upper hand on the antagonist and the only reason they were defeated is because of their own recklessness. I really enjoyed Manny's detective work and figuring things out on his own, and how that resolved made me upset. Kyun is nice but she's also a fucking moron ... because she, alone, in the middle of the night, visits a predator that she knows is targeting her. I guess we're meant to believe the antagonist had the MC's best interest at heart because they didn't off Kyun, but it just didn't work for me. Trying to humanize a serial killer is just ridiculous. I did binge read it wanting to see how it would finish, so it certainly has some appeal to it."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I'm the type of person who thinks that the journey is more important than the ending itself and that's why I can give this series a 9/10.

A solid point is the mix between many genres with creates a fresh narrative, getting some romance scenes in a thriller/psychological horror manga was a pleasant surprise.

Every single dialogue and arc serves a purpose here, either it's essential to the story, or it's just too good to be left out. This manhwa IS an out and out filler-less brilliance Bastard follows a weakling handicapped student who gets bullied constantly and he hates his father for some reason. The reason being that his father is a psycho murderer who uses his kid to knock women out for him to violate, torture and kill. What a way to kick things off A big reason as to why I am such a fan of this manhwa is ... grounded in the fact that how realistic this Manga is, it never gets ahead of itself. The protagonist Jin Seon is a handicapped weakling who tries to get stronger with training but remains the way he is throughout the length of the story and doesn't turn into a Shonen manga hero in a couple of months. Even though being a good person at heart, he is still an accomplice to his father and is brought to justice by the end. Father Seon, being a powerful entity and a total lunatic who treats his son like shit, is still cautious of police and law enforcers and deep inside still loves his son. Manny Kim is a big bully, but is also a human who has feeling. But right when you feel he's being too good of a person suddenly for what used to be a brutal bully, the story pulls you back to realise that yes, he still has a part of that twisted douchebaggery inside of him. Kyon Yoon is a simple yet stupid girl with needs, but takes stand for the people she loves. Also the protagonist isn't the only person she talks to, and has a life outside of this. She also isn't a total cutie either and has some edge to her. Characters in focus are limited (perfect for good thrillers) and have duality and depth in them, and aren't designated by author as just a perfect sample of good and bad only. The plot is very much possible to happen in real life too... The Plot here is a work of genius. It's essentially a well structured Suspense Thriller, with some interesting and much needed twists and turns throughout the course. The 94 chapters of length with no filler is ideal for it to stay interesting till the end. But beneath it's story, this Manga serves as a good sub-horror core with Father Seon playing a metaphorical devil. Jin Seons and everyone's facial reactions when they face Father Seon's reality, their horror is very palpable to the reader. Helps in further emersion of the reader into the story, to be really be invested in it. It is very dark at times, it has entire scenes worth of multiple pages where characters don't say a word but still say so much more. It has moments when you genuinely feel happy or sad for characters (is great considering its a thriller still). It has near perfect character development and ending is one of the best in any mangas/Manhwas ever. I was very satisfied. This is fucking amazing! A must read for everyone really"}, {"score": "8", "content": "This was surprisingly good. I found this form someones twitter post and holy shit. This isnt what I expected. I loved the dynamics between the two main characters. Seon Jin and Seon Dongsoo are great characters. I loved how they interacted. Ive seen tons of animes and I barley seen any where the antagonist is their parents or family. I loved the change. the art is really good too. It can feel like a horror because of the way its drawn. Some of the chapters were great too. The ending was crazy. Dongsoo is really good at manipulating people so youl'll never know when hes ... not lying even in the end (except you kinda do) I loved the way this manga is. The side characters and everything. I like how not everything Dongsoo did was exempted in the end. He still was a shit father who didnt undserstand his son. Even Jins uncles were more caring than him. I aslo like how Dongsoo was rich. It changed a lot and showed different dynamics between the wealthy classes. Dongsoo's actions with his son is very questionable. With him joking around with him and killing his bully's family. He liked to play with Jin a lot during the series, but whenever he was fighting the other serial killer there was a huge chance for Jin to die? What would have Dongsoo done if Jin died there? I also like how everything with his mom was explained. She didnt like his hobby but child Jin did. Than Jin gets handicapped because of his Mom. Its super sad. Apart from the family dynamic which i loved there were the other characters. I really liked how Manny was seen from a different perspective form Bully to a friend. That changed throughout the series, but im glad Jin stayed loyal to him. even after the Nerd Fight. Kyun was also a cool person. Shes really nice and just a cool person. I wish we got to see more of her life when she not around JIn (not counting the end) This also proves how the ending makes Dongsoo a nicer person because he paid her debt off just because Jin liked her. Lmao the scene where she was with Dongsoo explaining why she dosent like him was ironically funny and kinda scary, but this proves he didnt have bad intent in the beginning. Even though he acted like he did? Its kinda confusing if u think about it too much tbh. Thats the same thing with HeavyRain. Which also had a huge plot twist in the end. I liked the psychological factor of the series, but it all couldve been avoided if they just talked. That definetly wouldve been hard since Jin believed that his dad pushed him off and caused his injuries. Also his Dad is hard to talk too and he makes his son help him with his killings. Honestly does he force his son too? Since the hospital scene im pretty sure Jin was disgusted by his hobbies. If so than why continue them? Maybe because it would be awkward if he just stopped showing interest. Anyway in the end we can see why Dongsoo was angry at Jin. He told so many people about his hobby so they get in a fist fight. Thats totally fine. If you had an accomplice that told people that u were a murderer and u almost get beaten to death by his friends why wouldnt u take revenge, but he didnt. He let jin live. If anyone else was his accomplice he wouldve killed them, but he didnt which shows he cared about his family, but couldnt show it easily. Maybe the whole perspective in the beginning was biased by jin and those plain faces he made was what he thought he felt. This still dosent excuse why he slapped his kid in school though. When he said that there was a guy he was interested in; however in the last chapter he brought that up which feels like a plot hole. Would he have killed a girls family if he named a girl. I also really liked whenever they got out of the police station. Dongsoo started talking to Jin about what he thinks happened and if he really is a murderer which was a good foreshadow. Honestly my favorite moments of the series is with Dongsoo, Jin, Manny. OMG I gotta talk about how Jin ignored Manny and told everyone that asked that he was friends with Manny. What he got afterwards was deserved, but what Manny has done to other people was really fucked up. Overall to conclude This series is awesome. Ill forget about it in a month and remember it every few months"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Why 10? (Writing this review for myself) 1. ART ---> - Art makes it fairly easy to read the story, unlike many Manhwa/Manga, where the art and the writing mix up with each other.

He is not a coward (although cautious), despite his physical disabilities. - Stupid Female lead, but that's an essential element. She is adorable too. - The Villain (Devil) is an amazing character. The Villain is kinda funny! (His kindness act + concerned father act + His evil laughs) - Devil actually has some sanity! (It's emotional) 3. STORY ---> - Girls have been disappearing in the locality. Somehow the Protagonist is involved with them. First chapter is enough to captivate you to go through the entire Manhwa. - 'A FATHER and a SON.' - Devil VS Wimp. - Will he protect his crush from the Devil? - Adorable moments too! - Devil actually has some Sanity! (It feels!) - Last few chapters are my favorite ones. - Good Ending! (You want that, right?) 4.

Besides the obvious, Korean vs Japan, and coloured vs black and white. I guess which one takes more effort or is better? At first, you would say man wah because it's all in colour or Manga because of how much longer it has been going for, but I think Bastard gives us an answer right in between. Bastard shows us that there are merely styles, suited for different genres. For example, what's scarier, a black and white picture of a 6-foot tall monster? Or a serial ... killer slowly approaching covered by the night in full colour, keeping you on your toes for the big reveal of their face. Bastard is the best psychological horror I have read in a while, rivalled by parasyte the maxim. While they both share similarities, Bastard proves that Manwah can stand on its own, if not be superior in some categories. TLDR: Sorry for not giving a lot about the actual story, but it is very very good, the story is great, the ideas are perfectly executed, and the tension is kept high to the end. ESPECIALLY the end. I would recommend reading it on mobile, as one of this manwahs main strengths is being read in one long vertical format."}, {"score": "5", "content": "Bastard This manhwa is almost something of a \"love-hate\" relationship for me. I love it, but at the same time, I can hardly list the moments in how often the plot stumbled and how average the writing style is. [Story 4] The premise is simple, the seemingly lovable father is a complete psychopath and serial killer and the protagonist is his accomplice who wants to get away from him. The story follows a very monotonous and transparent path to the end. There is a small twist at the end regarding the protagonist's accident, but that's about it. There are no great ideas and the story simply ... unfolds as if you were playing some little crime game on Nintendo. What impressed me most about the manga was the atmosphere between the characters. It was simple and nothing new, but it made the characters seem important. And I actually even hoped that they wouldn't die, which is very rare for me. The Manwha also has a lot of flaws in the plot structure. In advance, I hated how openly the manga was concluded without seeing the consequences of the protagonists better, as well as the aftermath. The manwha put such a great focus on the \"opinion of others\" and on the image of society and at the end when everything was finally revealed, there is a time skip and done. Equally problematic is the incompetence of the police in the bastard world. The way people were kidnapped was not a mastermind plan, it happened mostly in the open and by invitation. In particular, there were some who even applied to be tutors. And you seriously want to sell me that there was not a single witness statement that proved \"Person X.. tutors student B in building Z today and disappears?\" as if all the people who were kidnapped were invisible to society and did not have a single contact person. Since this was never elaborated on, there is no room left for speculation. What was revealed, however, is - All persons disappear in a certain district. All disappeared persons have immensely many similarities. All disappear without being able to observe the abduction. There is a private building with one floor where all cameras have been removed. Even after the protagonist gave a hint and there was a patrol, they didn't feel like it after 2 days. Either Korea doesn't feel like chasing killers anymore or the number of missing people just wasn't high enough. The only reason the father made it this far in the first place was that the author just wanted it that way and didn't feel like making his approach more complex. In real life, he wouldn't have lasted half a year. [Characters 5] We have the sad protagonist who is the assistant of the demon. His whole character arc consists only of finding more determination. And besides, he worries about friends. The protagonist was not bad, he had his moments of brilliance. But not someone I will remember for a long time. The protagonist is practically Uraraka from My Hero Academia 2.0 and that's it. Only her character arc is a bit darker. There is nothing to tell about her personality, she is the \"good girl\" type who works hard. The school bully Manny Kim was by far the most interesting character, thanks to his contradictory and hypocritical character development. He himself didn't know what he was doing and how he was passively changing as he went along, but this had been given a relatively interesting conclusion. The Father - He has indeed been a very malevolent being and has given the series a certain menacing atmosphere. At least only at first. The more you saw him talking rather than doing, you realized he was a very passive killer. He reminded me of the \"Trinity Killer\" from Dexter, how to get away with Murder. These 2 were similar in their sick worldview and wrong behavior. [Drawings 4] Below average, but with such a small Webton project you can't expect a world wonder. Mostly you saw the same places and backgrounds were massively beside the point and mostly barely present. Only the characters were in focus and they were not drawn very well. [Conclusion 5] Is Bastard a good manwha? No, it's hardcore average, the author lacked experience, and that by far. However, Bastard is a manwha that definitely needs to be read as a thriller fan. Despite everything, has been relatively captivating and still managed to be very convincing through some moments. Even an average thriller can be good.

Cirrus is quite a competitive and proud guy, dare I say arrogant too, and the curiosity he feels about Skylar at first if it's something that only happens in bl's but it seemed quite natural despite that.

El guíon está bastante bien, te das cuenta que la trama es buena cuando sentís que los capítulos son demasiado cortos y ya querés que se suba el próximo, además de que el arte, la dirección de los paneles, el uso de las sombras, colores, absolutamente todo le lleva siglos a muchos otros manhwas, personalmente vale realmente la pena leer con atencion y prestarle importancia a cada detalle."}, {"score": "9", "content": "little obs - eng isnt my fist lenguage \"𝙖𝙩 𝙛𝙞𝙧𝙨𝙩, 𝙄 𝙩𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙝𝙚 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙚 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙡𝙠𝙚𝙧, 𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙥𝙝𝙤𝙩𝙤𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙖𝙣𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙜𝙪𝙮 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙖𝙨𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜...\" First I want to talk about the art in case you are those who care more about it than the narrative.

For me Lost in the Cloud is not just a bl manwha, but a romance about two desperate people who grew up in different circumstances who just want love, comfort and security. Although the story has an enemies to lovers premise, it becomes tortuous, after all they don't hate each other, they are both so deep in their psychological pain that they don't understand reality and without even noticing they end up doing something stupid. - however now for the warnings : The story features internalized homophobia (smaller), mentions of abuse, as well as some scenes that depict it, violence and blood. I recommend reading it and if any of the topics don't appeal to you Lost in Cloud, I would say that it appears to be a romance of the type that destroys the person, running from the inside out, that both are using each other to balance their imperfections, and yet we hope that we are wrong, but, it wouldn't be in the same equal to them? \" [...] 𝙄'𝙢 𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙞𝙛𝙚𝙙[...] 𝘼𝙛𝙧𝙖𝙞𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪 𝙢𝙚...𝙮𝙤𝙪'𝙡𝙡 𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙙 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙝𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙨. 𝗮𝗳𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂, 𝗜 𝘄𝗼𝗻𝘁 𝗯𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 𝗼𝗻.\""}, {"score": "10", "content": "“You've never even known what it's like to be loved growing up.

In these four years I think I have matured and my view on the story has changed.

I've never met anyone with the same opinion as me, although I liked the ending, I missed how things were in the beginning. It's like they're two separate stories, maybe that's because the characters developed and ... just like me changed over time.I'm still a little bothered by some points that could be better developed, especially involving Skyler's past traumas. Cirrus, who was introduced as a cold guy and a bit of a sociopath, became an insecure and dependent character, what let me a bit disappointed. What bothers me the most is the change of art, I'm sorry, I know it's a lot of work, but the initial art was sincere and expressive, the scenes in the playground are breathtaking, but after that the art got kind of...common, I don't know how to explain. While I really like the story and the ending it had, I feel like halfway through the process the author lost a bit of passion for the project."}, {"score": "10", "content": "This is probably one of the most emotionally complex manga I've ever read. I started reading it thinking it was a cute romance, because of a post I saw, but in reality it's just depression. What I loved most about this story is how all the main characters have questionable personalities: MC is a creepy stalker, he takes pictures of his crush without permission for months. ML finds out and uses this to blackmail and play with his mind. But since MC has a super sad past and is the main character, Cirrus ends up looking like the villain. I understand what he does, I wouldn't ... look kindly on someone who did this to a friend of mine either, but we get attached to Skylar too and want to see him happy. However, Cirrus is also a complex character with an even worse past. He doesn't know how to make friends, he doesn't know how to approach Skylar and he has a yandere personality. That's why we also root for him to be happy. It's not a question of choosing a side or right or wrong, it's not that black and white. They're both wrong, they're both trash people, but they suffer so much that we find ourselves rooting for a breath of fresh air in the midst of so much going wrong. So it's a toxic romance, but where both are bad guys. Skylar is super reactive and aggressive, Cirrus is devoid of empathy, unless it involves the one he loves. There are a lot of complex feelings and two fucked up guys finding comfort in each other, because they're the only ones who understand each other and can be who they really are with each other. It's a toxic relationship, but it works, because they're what keeps each other somewhat sane. I cried a lot while reading it, for the first time I was scared and had triggers with some themes. I can usually read something like this without any problems, but this series caught me off guard. I love complex and fucked up characters, so I love Skylar and Cirrus, even Chan-il has his dark side (I hope it is developed better in the next chapters). Every three chapters I thought about suicide, this story really made me miserable, but I love it. I love feeling such great sensations and having such impactful experiences just by reading a story, feeling all kinds of feelings with a work of fiction. That's why it's a masterpiece for me, the touch of realism, the drama, the relationships, the characters... I have nothing to complain about. Maybe just the amount of flashbacks, there are so many, I don't see much need to show them all, when just telling a few is enough. For important events, their childhood, I understand, but even silly things have flashbacks. SPOILER: I think I have a soft spot for yandere characters. I loved reading Cirrus pushing Skylar's friends away and making him get his heart broken, and then finding out the reason for everything. Is that a really fucked up way to do something for the good of the person you like? Sure, but it's entertaining. The fact that Skylar seems like a poor thing, but he harassed both guys because he once had a crush and how he is so physically and verbally aggressive with Cirrus... I would hate if only one of them was such a piece of trash, but since it's both of them, it seems balanced and I can just enjoy the feelings."}, {"score": "8", "content": "I'm ngl man despite the fact that I was forced into Reading this...I'm not that mad.

But I have to give the positives too, there is an INSANE amount of character development, if you want a story with stupidly flawed characters that you watch ... get better, then read it.

It turns out she reincarnated to the princess who had miserable life in the book she was read. Her dad, the king, is a cold-heart person that want to kill her. This story begins with the simply idea of MC who want to survive from her bloody dad. Then it turns to romance/comedy story. But what make this manhwa interesting is 'MC can change the story'. The readers are in the same view as MC, we won't know what will happen ... next. The past is shown from time-to-time, that makes we understand the story little by little. If you love the isekai story with gorgeous-lovely looking characters with a strong romance story, this manhwa is the right choice. As I read from light-novel, I can say that this manhwa try to keep every details from LN to be recognized in manhwa. #Art: 9/10 The art is great. The sapphire-like blue eyes are shiny as if as they were real gems. The design of every single dress of royal characters are incredible. Emotional face of each scene are touchable. Also the feeling of the wind blow was so real, I really love it. #Character: 10/10 Each character, even she is a maid, have their own back history. I love how they showed them from the very beginning when the MC was just a baby how personality they were and how they grown up. They have reasonable reasons to do any action, especially MC. Each character has their own unique personality that make you have to choos with team you are on (lol)."}, {"score": "3", "content": "This is an issikai. If you have seen/read \"My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!\" you'll find a lot of the same traits here. The protagonist wakes up as the newly born unwanted princess and spends her younger years gaining the affection of her father, who for her first years is conflicted about protecting and loving her, and wanting to kill her. Princess' mum died essentially because of the princess, or so it's heavily implied. It was partially cutesy and partially annoying, the significant scenes were downplayed because of the protagonist basically being a grown-up, and having this \"you're such an ... asshole\" in those first years. The story continues when she's 14, having a debutante, and then sometime later, the amnesia trope strikes again, making her father forget all about the protagonist for the next eternity it feels like. Now, in its defense, it tries to do something properly out of it, not just an off-spin thing like most amnesia stories. On the downside it tries to make something properly out of it, not just an off-spin thing that lasts two seconds. There's a lot of things I haven't mentioned, and I'm not sure how much further I'll read, it's becoming rather stressful to read. But suffice to say, if you've read \"My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!\" you'll more or less be reading the same kind of story. If you loved that one, you're likely to love this one as well. But, if you're like me, and found the entire thing rather annoying, and tropey, despite its efforts to not follow tropes, then I suggest you leave it well alone. It's very charming and cute in the beginning, but I wouldn't say it's worth it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I remember I used to think this was some kind of Lolicon stuff when Instagram showed me a Tappytoon advertisement but I am seriously so happy that it turned out to be different. Story: 9/10 The story plot isn't exactly a new one but nevertheless, I enjoy it greatly as I am a fan of Isekai plots. Furthermore, you never know what happens and the interplay of the different characters adds more to the suspense. Moreover, I also like the fact that romance is not in the spotlight of this story. Art: 10/10 I would even give an 11 if it was possible. I find these images so beautiful, I ... really really love the appearances of the characters. The clothing is very detailed, much to my pleasure. And oh my God, the royal bloodline's jewel eyes hit differently. These are just out of the world. If they were real, I would probably think I died and landed in heaven somehow. The appearances are what made me read this series in the first place. I even read some parts repeatedly, just to savour the drawings with my eyes. Characters: 9/10 The characters are great! Each character has a meaning and therefore none of them feels as if they're not needed for the story. I am especially enamoured by Claude, Lucas and Felix. Those are my men. I also like Athy very much; the girl is too adorable for her own good. Enjoyment: 10/10 Obsession. Maybe that's what I feel with this manhwa.

Now I am patiently waiting for new chapters. There was a Christmas break (2019) and I suffered so much because every chapter feels like a cliffhanger to me..

Particularly those who have nostalgia of this being the series that introduced them to Korean webcomics. & Now while I do not have any particular “nostalgia” for this manhwa, I do have a certain fondness. As in, every once in a while, I regrettably come back to this series, despite promising myself that I’m over this phase. And given that I do have this particular attachment, I also have a lot to say. The art style of this manhwa, is no doubt amazing. Now in S1 the art is mostly ... simple. Save for a few panels, where the story demands the reader’s attention, most of it has minimal shading. This was due to the fact that at that time SPOON (the artist) was still working alone on this serialisation. But don’t get me wrong the art was still pretty to look at. However, as seasons passed, & SPOON took on more help (aka took in assistants), the art style, evidently, started to look better & better too. And I’m speaking like, almost every panel is fully rendered, there’s beautiful atmospheric lighting, the characters look gorgeous, etc etc. Hence, while I can’t say that the art style is my particular top most favourite ever, objectively speaking, it has to be one of the most beautiful ones I’ve seen in manhwas. Like, I’d be lying if I said I personally don’t consider it eye candy. The plot too is decently interesting too. Nowadays, while there is an over-saturation in the “tyrant father & isekai’d daughter” troupe series, this series was released back when this troupe was still becoming popular. So like alongside “Daughter of The Emperor” (Which was probably first of this troupe) “Who made me a Princess” helped the popularisation of this particular troupe. And whether you are a fan of this troupe or not, you have to admit, they both did impact the manhwa & k-novel market at least a decent lot, considering you’ll see at least 1 or 2 newly released Manhwa & k-novel based somewhat around this troupe each season. And even outside the father-daughter relationship focus of this story, the world itself is very somewhat intriguing to look at. Like, the stuff with the World tree, the cycle each soul goes through, etc etc. Also yea “Souls” are a big focus. And you start to notice that once we get to the whole, “Claude implicating a black curse upon his soul” stuff. Which, given the themes of transmigration & reincarnation of this story, is quite nice to see. It helps tie it all together. HOWEVER, given that the manhwa specifically is so character-driven we can’t forget to talk about them first & foremost. Athy:- I love young Athy’s sass. I like how she was always ready to save her tail first, trying to get out of the situation she was in. I like how mentally she always had comebacks to whatever somebody said to her. Her internal monologue was incredibly funny to read. During her toddler years, she was kinda the living embodiment of the meme “F*ck this sh*t I’m out”. Which is why it is kind of a shame that overtime a lot of her sass just kind of disappeared. And I know she was mostly sassy to just Claude in her head (& ig that dog duke too), so it wouldn’t make sense if she continued being like that even AFTER she warmed up to him, but it’s still kind of a shame. Also she is like really pretty. She’s also very mentally strong. Which honestly, combined with all the sh*t she is put through, makes me all the more sad for her. However, what’s more sad is that we don’t get to see her as an adult. And no, I’m not counting that technically SPOON drew an illustration of her as an adult in the “Creator’s Note” after the finale. I’m talking about how in canon she’s still 15 by end of the main story. FIFTEEN. To be honest for the past many months I’d been thinking that she’s at least probably 17-18 I thought she was an adult by now 😭 But no, she’s 15 in chapter 86, & canonically between the finale & that chapter she hasn’t aged up. What makes me the most sad about this is not just that the timeline passed by so slowly, but also because that her being 18 by the time her coronation happened would’ve, writing wise, been even a more significant moment considering on her 18th birthday, in the 1st timeline, she was executed. However, this time on her 18th birthday she would’ve been coronated & bathed in the love of her subjects, family & friends. [However, this doesn’t happen since she’s still 15. We don’t even get to see her live till 18.] Once again such a shame. I hope in the upcoming side stories we see her as an adult at least once. Claude:- He looks closer to Athy’s age than his own Throughout the course of the story, he is arguably one of the ones to go through the most development. Whether it be him having a negative development (like the during his “Amnesia” arc), or him developing in a more positive sense (like him warming up to Athy). [And I honestly I say this because majority of the other cast didn’t develop much aside from him & maybe Athy] Though despite him being an interesting character, subjectively, I really am not a huge fan of him. Which is bitter considering MAJORITY of the manhwa is about the father-daughter relationship between Claude & Athy. Some of the sub-plot points even came at an expense of drawing out the things that were happening with Claude (which I’ll get into later). Absolutely no doubt he comes to love Athy greatly, however, he was still a bad father to her. Specially in the manhwa, where his amnesia & sleeping arc are drawn out so much, it led to him being absent in a decent amount during Athy’s teens. I like that the story acknowledges that majority of the reason Athy forgives him so much is because he is her “father”, [but that acknowledgment is pretty much glossed over even though properly developing it would’ve made for an interesting bases for Athy & Claude’s relationship]. Like, Athy had literally never had a blood related parental figure in her life, which is why she tries so hard to grasp on to the relationship she has with him. It is specially due to this that it takes her a significant amount of time to finally leave Claude during his “Amnesia” arc. But even then she continues to still actively worry about him Also Claude’s copping mechanisms are something… Not something, “Good”. But rather something, “Send this man to a hospital” Like, they are not at all healthy. Not just for him, but also for others. It’s a pity he had to to resort to literally cursing himself to get over the grief of losing his lover, however, that same curse led to him killing all of his concubines in the Ruby palace. Those woman didn’t even do anything ☠️. It led to him executing Athy & the fall of the ENTIRE Obelian empire in the first timeline. It led to him (while it may have been unwillingly) neglecting Athy until she was old enough to talk & walk. And it led to him being somewhat absent during Athy’s teenage years. Sure it’s a pity, but that’s all a consequence of his own actions. And I genuinely don’t think just apologising like the way he did cuts it. I honestly don’t even feel that bad for him considering he gets out of these crimes practically scot free. Like sure, there’s nothing else he can actively do either, but that also doesn’t mean people didn’t straight up die as consequence of his direct actions. I wholeheartedly agree, he loves Athy, but he was not able to be a good father for her. Ijekiel & Jenette:- [Respectively] There’s not that much to about Ijekiel other than the fact that I do like him. He’s a nice guy, & honestly I do feel lowkey bad for him. Like the fact that he grinned at Lucas, when Athy said she won’t marry anyone, because he knew he didn’t have a chance with her either way, but her saying that meant that she won’t be marrying Lucas either, was both incredibly funny but also slightly tragic at the same time 😭🤣 But also he’s fairly underdeveloped. There’s not much to him other than his connection to Aeternitas via his father & his feeling for Athy, Same with Jenette, not much to say about her. She is precious, & if you think otherwise you are simply wrong. I’m sorry, I don’t make the rules, I simply enforce them. A lot of people criticize her for her naïveté, however, people do tend to forget that she’s like a 14-15 kid, who grew up incredibly sheltered. There’s also the fact that almost everyone around her was very scheming yet almost never tried to make her aware of what was actually going on. So no wonder she grew up not being aware of the two faced nature of the people & situations around her. Lucas:- Let’s get this out of the way first, he’s very pretty. He is absolutely gorgeous I simp for him a bit too much. But honestly, how can I not?? Anyways, I saved him purposefully for last. Now, he honestly is a decently mysterious characters. Both from when he is introduced in season 1, up until the finale, he has somewhat of an air of mystery. I do find his past relationships very interesting honestly. Like his relationship with that one unnamed white haired guy. Honestly, who was he even was he? I don’t think the manhwa ever even properly reveals that dude’s identity. Having said that, I do genuinely wish his past was explored more in detail, instead of just vague flashbacks here and there. Because SO much of his background is simply left ambiguous Like, -Who were his parents? We don’t know. He says that he just spontaneously came into existence, but it’s pretty obvious he’s lying. I genuinely do not think he poofed into existence 💀 [Also, there’s the fact that in the S1 flashback it’s mentioned he was birthed, so yea he lied. For quite literally no reason too] -Why is Lucas the way he is? For most of it, we don’t know why. -Why did the white haired guy keep calling Lucas tragic, pitiful, etc? We aren’t really given an answer. My guess is maybe because he is an orphan, but I’m pretty sure there’s more to this than just that. -How did white haired guy’s family die? No definite answer is given. Maybe if his family wasn’t adept in magic, so they could’ve died of old age, while the white haired guy remained. But that’s, once again, pure speculation here, as we aren’t given a definite answer. -Why was Lucas soo detached from what people normally feel, & was incapable of understanding normal emotions? That possibly had to do something with his early life, but the story didn’t focus on that, so we, yet again, don’t know any proper answer. -Why does he hate nobles SOOOO much? No definite answer, other than the fact they are obnoxious according to him. Chapter 116 does kind of focus on Lucas’ past, but he dodges a lot of the questions or with the ones he did answer, they had odd answers. *Cough* Spontaneous generation, despite the fact that according to the S1 flashback to his past, we know he was actually birthed. *Cough* X——————X I’m gonna guess, the novel has all the answers, & delves into his past more. I’m also gonna guess that a big reason why his past remains very ambiguous is because they simply did not have the time to cover his whole past. The manhwa deviated from the novel a few years back (More specifically, from S2 and onwards). There’s also the fact that we’ve known for quite a while now at which chapter the manhwa will end [Initially it was announced that it would only be 110 chapters long, however, as we got closer to that chapter cap, the cap was elongated]. So given all this I don’t think they had enough time. Which makes me WISH that the Claude & Athy stuff was a bit shorter. Towards the later seasons, the manhwa only mainly started focusing on Claude & Athy’s relationship. And like sure, that is a major part of the premise of the series, but it kinda did get to the point that it was coming at the cost of Athy’s other relationship progressions. Like we stopped seeing Lily as much. Which is very sad. Like specially in S3, she really is not there as much. And also evidently subplots like Lucas’ early life (something that was being set up since S1), ended up getting a major short end of the stick. I’m pretty sure that chapter 116 was the way it was exactly because his past was never delved into prior, & now they just didn’t have much time left because the manhwa was ending real soon. Aka this is why majority of the latter half of the chapter was a Q&A format. Where Athy asked questions, & Lucas gave an answer. It’s not just Lucas’ past, or Lily getting sidelined, it’s also the existence of the “Lovely Princess” novel in Korea. Once again, the story does try explain as it’s concluding, but it’s explained in a form of an info dump with Athy’s internal monologue while she’s trying to sleep. And a few sentence short convo between Lucas & Athy. Also the answer just watered down to: Athy’s magic is capable of impacting the material world. Which is why the “Lovely Princess” novel exists. She made a whole another reality where she could live, & that was “our world” (aka the world where she lived in Korea). The novel was sort of the world the Obelian empire is in, except Athy’s magic turned it into a book. My initial question was just, how does “Lovely Princess” - a book accounting some of the history of the Obelian empire - exist in South Korea, but like according to this explanation Athy just apparently has God powers. SHE IS CAPABLE OF CREATING WHOLE WORLDS. WHAT??? Story, please delve into this a bit. This raises a lot more questions than it answers 😃 Stop leaving random plot points unanswered But no, the explanation cuts gets off by Lucas asking whether they should go out for dinner. TO EAT. Oh my God— [Also if Athy’s want to live again was so great it manifested into a LITERAL WORLD for her, would her want of having a family also not manifest?? Like that was her whole thing in the first timeline, so why did she become an orphan who was thrown around by society??? What exactly are the logistics of how her power works???? We don’t fricking know. The story doesn’t bother to explain.] Why do we wait until last minute to answer subplots, but then straight up either dodge around them, or cause more questions?? Like yes, they didn’t have the time to explore these plot points. The manhwa was ending REAL SOON by the time we got to them, but at this point don’t even answer them. The story just glosses over Athy’s universe altering power. Like it straight up dodges it the same chapter they bring it up. This is why I WISH things other than just Claude & Athy got more time, If only the Claude stuff wasn’t stretched out so much, we could’ve given a better conclusion to majority of the subplots. But whatever. I don’t care anymore. I’m fine. X——————X So would I recommend? Yes & no.

The story revolves around Athanasia, a young girl who is reincarnated as the princess of a magical kingdom. However, she soon discovers that her life is in danger due to a curse placed upon her by her own father, the king. One of the strongest aspects of this manga is its well-developed characters. Athanasia, the protagonist, is a likable and relatable character who undergoes significant growth throughout the story. Her determination to change her fate and protect herself from harm is inspiring. The supporting characters, including the ... charming prince, Lucas, and the loyal knight, Claude, add depth and complexity to the narrative. The artwork in \"Who Made Me A Princess\" is beautifully done, with detailed illustrations and expressive character designs. The manga effectively captures the emotions of the characters, enhancing the overall reading experience. The vibrant and colorful visuals also bring the fantasy world to life, immersing the reader in the story. The plot of the manga is intriguing, filled with suspense, political intrigue, and unexpected twists. It successfully blends light-hearted and comedic moments with more intense and dramatic scenes. The pacing is well-balanced, keeping the reader hooked and eager to know what happens next. Another notable aspect is the romantic subplot, which adds an extra layer of sweetness to the story. The growing relationship between Athanasia and Lucas is portrayed with care and tenderness, making it enjoyable to follow their interactions. However, one potential drawback is that the story occasionally rushes through certain plot points, leading to missed opportunities for deeper exploration or character development. Some readers may also find the plot predictable at times, especially if they are familiar with common tropes in the fantasy genre. Overall, \"Who Made Me A Princess\" is a delightful manga that will appeal to fans of fantasy and romance. It offers a well-crafted story, compelling characters, and beautiful artwork that will keep readers eagerly turning the pages. Cheers,"}, {"score": "6", "content": "To say the least, I enjoyed reading WMMAP. It’s a refreshing story that focuses more on the father-daughter relationship and less on romance. We’re made aware of the reasons for Claude’s initial hate for Athy. Just like Athy, at first, I hated him for killing original Athanasia. As the story progresses and as his motivation was revealed, I couldn’t help but empathize with him. Athy really doesn’t have any lofty ideals and frankly, I can’t think of anything about her personality that stands out. She simply wants to survive and live until 18 and perhaps as a result of her previous life, she doesn’t have ... much expectations. Sure, she does like sparkly things and was delighted when she was given a treasury key, she doesn’t really make it her goal of obtaining it. She doesn’t desire to be loved and is perfectly fine without it. She’s very much independent and strangely, has decent morals. However, I don’t see her as someone as kind as a saint. She has no qualms in insulting Roger Alpehus, because she sees him as someone manipulative. On the other hand, she is very kind towards people that wouldn’t bring her harm and is very vocal about her dislike of someone, if it doesn’t harm her life. Athy is very clear that she would do anything to survive. For people who want to see the protagonist undergo major character change, Athy would definitely not fit your tastes. I don’t see her as Mary Sue. However, she definitely doesn’t have any fatal character flaw. For anyone who has read too much isekai about a girl wanting to escape her destiny of getting killed, this story would bore you. Just like what I’ve said, it doesn’t introduce anything new nor does it subvert your expectations. You could easily find the characters in WMMAP in any other story. Perhaps the only redeeming factor about this story is its outstanding art and decent development. One thing’s for sure, the author knows what foreshadowing is. At the very least, the characters have their own motivations that are otherwise hard to realize unless you look carefully. WWMAP is at best, average and at worst, bland. Nevertheless, it was a good read."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Final arc in this adaption was awful and, per those who read the novel, was a mere portion of the latter-part of the story. So everything else that was interesting or important to the worldbuilding was ignored. For a far too prolonged mini-arc. And, then it ends. However, even with the knowledge some of the novel was copied from another person's similar story, the writing itself was good. It's one reason it managed to get more people interested in this particular genre and tropes, with a lot of help from the amazing art. So even if you're particular with how adaptions end, it's not as ... bad as already complained. That said, it's more annoying how too many will reference this series as *the* representative for this genre and will instinctively compare newer, at times better, series to it. . The story revolves around our FL who isekai'd into a novel she read. With her memories of that life, she doesn't expect much from her father nor forms an attachment to the palace that merely fed and housed her. So she planned to leave even before she could crawl and slowly built herself strong enough to do so. Both physically and through people connections. But as fate would have it, she wound-up meeting her father and subsequently living a pretty good life. Aside from the looming sense of doom that she'll be killed and her love forever unrequited. So the original timeline was plenty altered by the time the story was set to begin. And then came the expected drama. Overall, until the final arc, the story was well-paced and engaging. Hints were thrown about, as were red-herrings, and only those who read the novel or its summaries knew what to expect. It truly is an enjoyable read. So if the final arc was treated properly as a mini-arc, even if the adaption were to still end there, it'd be a far better story. With just as much left unsaid."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I was one of the people pointing fingers and mocking these LN adaptations about boys getting kicked into fantasy settings filled with gorgeous women wanting to get a piece of them. What a fool. \"Who made me a princess\" begins in the cutest way imaginable: a woman gets reincarnated as a baby princess that is destined to die throughout a classic fantasy story. Baby is determined for that not to happen, and decides to be the most adorable creature imaginable to avoid that fate. If you get tired of heart squeezing toddler hijinks (and I never was, mind you, but IF you are), time passes and various different ... \"love interests\" begin to pop up as the child turns into a young woman and the actual story starts to take place. It consists mostly of trying to keep her alive while not completely rewriting the story, although there are many hints as the plot progresses that not everything is as it seems. The art is absolutely stunning, every page filled with a gorgeous array of vibrant colours, and even if the character designs fall into same-face-syndrome at times, the amount of detail and care that are put in each drawing completely make up for it. An utter joy to see the various dresses and hairdos our main character changes into, dumb point, but I honestly looked forward to them. And the characters themselves (shoutout to our main princess) are precious. The way people change throughout the manhwa is heart wrenching, from cold bastards to hot bastards ;) All winks and nudges aside, the relationship between characters can be exceptionally sweet and can (sometimes) progress in an adequate measure of time, especially taking into account the years some of them pass together. A complete guilty pleasure for me, it just gives me everything I wanted from an isekai. Like, haven't you ever wish to be able to redo your whole life again, knowing what you know now? AND be rich and cute? I dont even know what else you want man."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Who Made Me A Princess, a shoujo isekai in which the character dies and somehow gets transported in another world she knows. When she was transferred, she became Athanasia de Alger Obelia. The most miserable character in “Lovely Princess”. Her goal is to survive and avoid execution caused by her father, Claude. The story is not the most original, but you don’t need to be original to make something good. The story in my opinion has the best pacing I could possibly crave for. Its good enough for character development and the continuing of the plot. I really can’t say much about this part to avoid ... spoilers, but what i can certainly say that its a REALLY GOOD STORY. I don’t really need to talk about art here, do i? Its so good to the point whenever I read another manga or webtoon, it looks like a peasant compared to this. It made my standards jump way too high, tho I really dont mind. Well kudos to spoon for having eye jumping art. The characters, aside from the art is the best thing I really like about this whole webtoon. They develop in a very human way, at first I thought that they would immediately love each other ( Claude and Athy I mean) the moment they first saw each other, well mostly Claude. But it didn’t. At first, it was all a scheme for Athy, a way to survive. Yet they found themselves loving each other more and more. Claude in particular is a very interesting character, he seems like your typical male character in a shoujo, he is, well kind of. When the author develops Claude more, you see him becoming more and more human. He becomes a person, a person who was hurt and refused to be manipulated and had enough with everyone. That situation is very possible in reality, despite his rejection, he found himself being in love again. He found himself in love and he found himself being able to love. Athy, best girl, fight me. Her character is the person I aim for lol. She’s a girl who is not naive ( I had enough with naive mc’s) and thank god. But moreover, what i found in her was really warm. Despite knowing that she may die in the hands of Claude one day, she calls him daddy and turns into a real “Daddy”, a dad she never experienced. She is a kind, and anything but a lovable character. A character that somehow, we relate to in some way. I really enjoyed the whole thing. Every single day, I wait for a new chapter, patiently and at the same time I crave for more. Wondering what will happen next, to fill in such void, I reread the entire story, but I never get enough of it. I always find myself enjoying it no matter how many times I read it. If you ask me if you should read it. What’s stopping you? In my opinion, legit one of the best stories I have read. I makes your emotion go around. It makes you feel and realize things you never knew. Its great, its nothing but something great. You don’t even need to ask if its worth it, from the start and hopefully till the very end, it would have the same worth and maybe even gain more worthy that would definitely captivate your heart. But, a part of me somehow says that, it would definitely grow more, and be more worthy than it is now. In other words, it would turn out even greater till the very end. And like I said, it doesn’t need to be original to be original. And, thats what makes this story, the story that i love, the story that I would certainly be glad to have read...

First, I really do like the story and I am really looking forward to every update. The story might not be that original cause it is about a girl who died and got isekai to another world and that world is a novel story and to tell the truth, I have read many manga and manhwa with that kind of plot but this one for me has its own flavor and color. I love how the author plays the plot and new events happens everytime. This manhwa is one of ... the stories that makes me have mix emotions like happiness, cuteness, sadness, anger, disappointment, excitement and sometimes it is very heart breaking. Another thing is that I love the art of Who made me Princess cause it is not every day where you can encounter this kind of art cause it is very beautiful and the art gives justice to the story and it is another factor for me. I really recommend this manhwa cause you will never regret reading this one and it is not a waste of time. You will love the characters and especially their development through time and how Athy overcomes and overpowers his father Claude with love that makes him change his attitudes towards her and how the author pierced my fragile heart with his plot twist and how I wish Lucas was there cause he will never allow that to happen to Athy. That's all and I do hope that you will also like Who Made Me a Princess and hope you would not mind my spoiler alert :)"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Story (⅗. Typical plot for a unique niche) The story goes back and forth between what happens in Who Made A Princess (WMMAP) and Lovely Princess (the original world that the protagonist reincarnated into). This allows the readers to grasp the impact of the protagonist's actions and how it affects the future plot of the story. The story manages to subtly highlight complex themes such as the internal self and Fate vs Free Will while delivering it in a good balance between light-hearted and serious. The plot progression has some headscratchers, sometimes deus ex machina is obvious, and some parts of the world are filled with ... logical plotholes, but I think this work is a good starter for the classic family-oriented Otome Isekai – especially when the genre is very niche as of now. In my opinion, there are arcs that are either too short or too dragged out – I myself took a break from reading it because a specific arc felt too extended. As of now, the manhwa isn’t complete yet, but it seems like it will be near completion. Art (5/5. My eyes have been blessed. The lifeblood of the manhwa) The first thing that drew me into the manhwa was its art. I am continuously fascinated by how the artist colors and colors the sceneries and characters (especially the eyes). Every panel is either an aesthetically beautiful, eye-cleansing panel or a humorous, chibi-style panel. The contrast between the two styles amplifies its effects: the high-detail panels look even more detailed, and the chibi panels are even more adorable than how they already are. I would wax poetic about how the special effects and scenery blend well with other elements within each panel. It’s very obvious that a lot of work has gone into each chapter of the manhwa, and I personally look forward to the manhwa’s art the most every time a new update is released. While the manhwa’s art is really high-detailed and aesthetically pleasing, I think design-wise they seem pretty typical. For example, the main protagonist Athanasia has blonde hair and blue eyes, which is the most abundant hair-eye color combo in female Otome Isekai protagonists. The hairstyle designs are also pretty standard, nothing too crazy or innovative other than how gloriously well-detailed they are. In terms of clothing designs though, they are also quite pretty and unique, but it’s what you usually expect from Otome Isekais that are set in similar settings. P.S.: Okay this is a little bit TMI but the greatest testament to this is how well the artist drew Athanasia’s Father, Claude. I usually find blonde-haired male characters at the bottom of my list of favorite designs, but hot damn how does one not simp for Athy’s hot daddy Claude? The artist took character designs that I usually wouldn't really like, and transform them into top rankers in my simp agenda. Character (3/5. Unique characterization for first-timers, but pretty cliché in the genre.) I think character design falls under the art section, so I’m not going to go deep into that. In terms of characterization, we have many of the typical cliches that one would notice after reading a couple of other Otome Isekais. If the reader is new to the genre as a whole (which is often the case), the characters may seem quite unique especially because female characters are not the typical protagonists of an isekai plot. I can’t give much away about characters without spoiling too much, but as someone who was new to the genre when I started reading it, I find each character of the manhwa lovable in its own way – having enough level of depth but also light-heartedness. After reading other Otome isekai manhwas, however, the illusion kind of breaks apart after knowing that some character motivations seem more questionable when compared to other works within the genre. However, there are character interactions that I wished the author expanded more upon or hope they will in the future (if you’ve read WMMAP, you know which ship I’m talking about) Enjoyment (⅘. A trip to a mall. Go around the whole thing once, and then revisit the good parts. Content is content nevertheless) WMMAP is my go-to recommendation when I want to introduce someone to the world of Otome Isekai – a small taste or a shallow pond before they get fully interested in the genre. There are better Otome isekai manhwas out there with a better plot, more unique characters, character interactions that are healthier, but I think one can only appreciate that if they have something to compare it to. That, in my opinion, is the role of WMMAP – a beginner-friendly Otome isekai that keeps its readers through the beauty of its art while introducing them to the niche genre. I often reread this series simply to find aesthetically pleasing panels or revisit scenes that I want to re-experience, but I always skipped through the draggy parts. References to WMMAP are standard and widespread among the Otome isekai world, and I would argue that WMMAP has the most abundant fan content compared to other Otome Isekai series so far, so I relish the massive amount of content in a genre that is sparse of them."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Others said the \"the daughter's father is a cold-blooded emperor\" troupe in manhwa is cliche, but I think the story is good for the manwha beginners. The main character, Athanasia, aka Athy, initially focused on her survival by making two plans; plan A was to live a quiet and peaceful life without being noticed by her father, which is the \"terrifying\" emperor, and plan B was to collect enough money and escape the palace. Unfortunately, plan A failed due to her accidentally meeting with her father at the early age of 5 instead (it was stated in the Lovely Princess that Athy met her father ... at the age of 9), which made her make plan C, sweet-talking her way into her father's good graces. Throughout those many years of her pretending that she loves her father became genuine as she stated that \"Even if Claude no longer sees me as his daughter because of Jennette, Claude was the first father I ever had, and I have loved every moment of it.\". Her sincere love for her father made her willingly save her father from his curse, even if it is to sacrifice her life, which opposed her original goal to survive. The story also shows how Athanasia vaguely receives love and bonds from others that she mostly doesn't receive from her previous life. That made the story a family story and showed the importance of family and love (which is the most heart-warming part of the story) The art and the character designs are a masterpiece, especially the signature jeweled eyes and Athy's daily outfits The characters are interesting, especially the character development: Athy - Although she lost her personality of being sassy (which I really loved that trait), she overcomes her fears of losing the affection of her and the other people they made. She gradually understands the people around her, especially her father, instead of judging them just because of what was written in the book. I also like her being sharp-minded, especially in how she deals with her enemies and those who threaten her and her father. Claude - I know many people hated him for being a bad father. Even just asking for forgiveness from Athy needs his child to force him to do so, not on his own will. The most important thing to him is his character development. We know that he had a dark past, but that isn't an excuse for him to neglect his daughter. Time passes by, and as we witness his pov (especially chapters 101-102, which I'm crying ugly), we knew that he loved Athanasia from the start and will do anything for her even if his life will put in danger (just like Athy to him) which made me forgive him, although the novel version of them warming up is better than the manhwa version as I heard (I'll try to read it if I have enough time). Lucas - Though he's rude to others, he's a fun person that would spend time with, especially his interactions with Athy. One thing that made me admire him is how he lowkey supports Athy even though some are \"irritating\" him, which makes him very funny. The only thing that I don't like is how he's insensitive to others, which is the reason why Aeternitas (the one who's obsessed with Lucas) became a villain (he's the only one who turned like that out of all Lucas rejected according to him). Though, we already know that from his childhood, he isn't really attached to emotions, which is why his master pitied him and said \"A day will come when you understand, but perhaps it's best for you to never know.\". You can see how he changed so much before and after he met Athy. Jeanette - This is quite interesting because they said that her personality is different from the novel compared to the manhwa. Since we are talking about manhwa, let's talk about this version. At first, I dislike her for being naive and fragile but pitied her because she wasn't experienced in interacting and socializing with other people because her uncle limited her to go outside since she was made of black magic until I started to like her when she had character development when Aeternitas tried to possess her and she wasn't easily swayed anymore. I would love to see how does Jeanette look like if Spoon didn't change her personality. The problem is: - The climax part is kinda dry and rushed. It's kinda bland and not so exciting, especially when they healed Claude's curse, Claude and Athy opened up their thoughts, and the confrontation of Aeternitas and sealing him. The way how they resolved the problems was kinda simple and short. - The romance thing. Some parts of it feel like just a filler to make the story longer or just a fanservice like it doesn't give any sense to it. If Spoon planned to make the story family-focused, they should stick with it. Though everything started in chapter 115 was a good start, there was so much potential to it, but when Athy said \"I don't need to get married!\", it felt like the romance part wasn't necessary anymore. That also made me a question \"So Athy's gonna be single forever?\" \"Will she stand up to what she said or change her mind after some time?\" \"Who's gonna be her successor?\". Also, she can be with her father even though she'll be married to someone and have her own family (Claude, don't you want a grandchild/children?\" Overall, the story is fun and exciting at the beginning, but the amnesia and the sleeping arc are more exciting. It's like \"What will happen?\" \"What will Athy do?\", but again, some parts of the story are kinda lacking and useless, though, it's still heart-warming. The Art is enjoyable and you will love the characters. So that's all. Looking forward for the side story too ^^ Story - 8/10 Characters - 9/10 Art - 10/10 Overall - 9/10"}, {"score": "10", "content": "I recently saw one of the reviews, in which the author bluntly says that “Who made me a princess” is just another overrated manhwa and in fact it is not as good as everyone of us makes it out to be. I couldn’t disagree more with this mindset. Don’t get me wrong, I do not intend to make any shameful remarks about their opinion. Because it is just that, an OPINION. Nevertheless, here I intend to prove that “Who made me a princess” is in fact one of the greatest masterpieces of our time. Let’s first start with what make a piece of work, or rather, ... a piece of art, a masterpiece. According to Cambridge dictionary, a masterpiece is defined as “a work of art such as a painting, film, or book that is made with great skill”. In this case, as we all know that “Who made me a princess” is a manhwa, this “great skills” must be shown through art, story and characters. There for, to be awarded the title of masterpiece it has to show a combination of elegant and catchy art, perfectly written characters, and a coherent and deep story. In my opinion, this series nails them all. Why? That’s what I intend to explain here. Though I will not extend myself too much, as it could contain spoiler if I did. First let’s take a look at the story. Yes, it is an isekai, and yes, there may be too many of them out there. But that is not what it makes it quirky in my opinion. For instance, the fact that Athanasia as a baby has a conscience and can think like a grownup (this is not a spoiler, it is shown in the first few panels of the story) is much more of a quirk than the isekai concept. So what is it that makes the story a great one? It’s not only the fact that it has a coherent and cohesive plot, or the baseline of its narrative. It is the appeal to the readers empathy. Too many stories try to make you feel empathy for their characters with in-the-face strategies. But Plutus makes something that even the great writers of our generation struggle with: to subtly touch the right strings of emotion. And I refer to it as subtle because when you first start reading it, you think it’s your average heartwarming comedic story. But as you get more and more into its depths, you discover that it has more to it than just trivial troubles. Even if it tackles themes that may be found in other literary works, it does it with such elegance and uniqueness that it makes it a candy for the mind. And so, you find yourself enveloped by the world and its people, wanting to uncover the secrets that it hides and solve problems that cling in the air for the longest of times. This takes us to the characters. Even if the story is great, with a coherent plot and unique narrative points, it all goes to waste if the characters are not good enough for it. This is a problem that Plutus knew well. And as such, he counters it with perfectly written characters. Why is it that his tactic of appealing to one’s emotions works so well? Because they made characters with a solid personality that are believable, relatable and lovable. Critics know that when an author works their way into a reader’s heart to make them feel what the characters are feeling, it is a great writer that created great characters. “Who made me a princess” has that exactly. Through out the story, you can feel the joy, the love, the despair and even the loneliness of the characters even when you don’t know them so well. In the same manner, the characters are not just composed of one layer. Most of them are like onions: they have layers of complexity and depth. As the story goes by, you start learning more about their past, their personalities and even their future. You can witness their growth and their change to finally understand their complexity. Their interactions with other just makes them even more believable. Because, in the long run, they are more human than we can imagine a mere character to be. Last, but not least, is the art. To make it simple, it is just a candy to the eye. I think that was the first thing that caught my interest. It’s polished and neat, with flashy colors and big blue eyes. Despite the enormous bright eyes (that somewhat remind me of original Sailor Moon anime), it actually heavily complements the story and the characters. The art it’s not only there to be pretty and catch the eyes, but actually to leave traces of foreshadowing and give a deeper meaning to the story. I love this series, as you maybe have notice by now. I feel a heavy connection to it, and it has made me feel as no other series has ever done. I must admit that half of it made me suffer and cry and hope. It has also made me laugh and it has helped me understand too many things about us humans that I have never discover in someplace else. I just hope, to end this long review, that I have at least make you consider the fact that this “overrated series” is one of the best that you will ever read."}, {"score": "4", "content": "The romance tag is fake, this doesn't have romance whatsoever.

I don't know lol). Anyways, this is the first and only webtoon or manga that I've read to completion. The story was definitely without a doubt an enjoyable ride to read through, to say the least. The thing I was honestly the most captivated by was the art in this series, it was honestly gorgeous. Probably the most beautifully illustrated manga/webtoon I've ever seen. I especially enjoyed seeing all of the various beautiful dresses Athanasia would wear throughout the story. You could really tell that the artist for the series put a lot ... of love into illustrating all of the characters, but especially the MC. I also loved the plot itself. Though I will say, the ending did disappoint me a bit. It felt like the author took the easy way out, instead of risking dividing their audience over a certain issue. The author of the series chose to take a safe/non-offensive stance on something that I feel like they really shouldn't have. I won't spoil anything, but I will say I was very disappointed to not get any real closure on this issue. Other than having mixed feelings on the ending though, this series was honestly amazing to me. I now have all of the volumes of this story in a physical book-form, which I've actually never done with a manga/webtoon before.

I definitely recommend reading this manga/webtoon!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "As I immerse myself in the pages of this captivating manhwa, I can confidently declare that it was an incredibly worthwhile journey. Yes, it falls into the isekai genre and has hints of a love triangle, but at its core, it beautifully revolves around the heartwarming relationship between a father and his cherished daughter. To my delight, not a single chapter left me bored; I was hooked from start to finish. The art style, oh, the art style! It's an absolute delight. Sometimes it's playful and cute, tugging at my heartstrings, while other times, it delves into intricate details that have me transfixed on the characters, ... almost oblivious to the plot's progression. The artists' talent shines through, breathing life into the world they've crafted. Among the plethora of manga and manhua I've explored, this one truly stands out. Its ability to seamlessly blend emotions, action, and storytelling is truly commendable, making it a unique and extraordinary read. This gem has left a lasting impression on me, surpassing my expectations and distinguishing itself as a rare find in the realm of fantastical tales. In conclusion, this manhwa has taken me on an enchanting adventure, and I find myself yearning for more with every turn of the page. It's an absolute must-read for anyone seeking a story that will transport them to a world of wonder and leave an indelible mark on their heart."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I LOVE IT......... Words are less to describe how I feel about this story. From all the stories I have read about a woman reincarnating as the princess of another world this is, with no doubts, the best one of them. The story was interesting even when she was just a baby unlike \" The emperor's daughter \" and she us an actual interesting character and her goals are great, she actually works hard and tries her best to change her fate. This story captures how the king and his daughter truly becomes family even with the challenges that face them. To me this story is amazing and ... is really worth every second of my time. Many people here who have read this manga just knows that the art is not something you can complain about. The art is absolutely beautiful, and even on its more lacking panels it is still well put together. The scenes, character design, and color schemes are so nicely done that reading the boring parts of the story seem interesting. And at last, I'm going to talk about the characters, because each character in this manwha has depth to them, their own motivations, things they care about, not only for the sake of the plot but for them as a character and that can be quite rare to see so I really think this helps Who Made Me a Princess be such a well-done manwha."}, {"score": "8", "content": "This is my first review and I will keep it brief. And sorry for my bad English. -The story was okay at first. I know, it's pretty cliche since it's an isekai and it's about a girl who got reincarnated as a princess as we have seen in many romance mahwa nowadays. We get to see some characters and how the MC got along with each one. It's quite slow but somehow natural. And we also get some hints about what is going on underneath. The hints was dropped pretty frequently, enough to get you keep wanting to know what will happen next but not predictable. ... As the story going on and on, it gets more thrilling and when the drama reach its peak...OH BOI I was completely stunned. How can they plan it out so well, especially the villain's plan, and welp I won't spoiled. The solution was okay? I mean it feels somewhat unsatisfied? Like after so much trouble the villain has gone through to carry out such big plan and all it take to break that plan is love and magic??? So the story is 7/10 for me. -The art: Stunning and gorgeous. Definitely a 10/10. -The characters: They are very likable. The main characters are well developed though I find myself more interested in the side characters. They surely have their depths. I'm in love with Jennet 'cause she's such a pure girl and relatable character. She has the flaws and want to be loved just like any of us. The anti-hero is such a man of tragedy. I actually cried for him. And the main villain's reason to be a bad guy was errr... somewhat childish? The relationship between character is natural and doesn't feel forced at all. So I will give this a 8/10 -The enjoyment: I really enjoy reading this story. It maybe one of the best manhwa that I have read. It stirs up a lot of emotion inside me. The story has its own beautiful way to present the parental love, friendship, empathy, forgiveness and being true to yourself. So a 9/10. Overall, though it has its own flaws, the manhwa is pretty enjoyable to read. Therefore, I will give this manhwa a 8/10"}, {"score": "10", "content": "LOVE IT I've reread this to many times while waiting for new chapters gosh. This your typical isekai, reincarnation, historical medieval and what not story but it is written SO WELL. and the angst is just so on point.

Do you like it? Because if you do this is a must read for you, because this takes that thing you like from hamefura about a girl who is reincarnated in another world as a princess fated to death and how can I survive whole deal kinda thing, but in this manhwa it is a hot blond, sapphire eyed, chest naked with piercing cold aura daddy who is trying to ... kill our mc. Yes it's her DADDY. So I think you can imagine the family and heart warming relationship development that is waiting for you especially since our mc used to be an orphan in her past life. Hamefura is great, but it felt like a parody because of how light the story felt, this on other hand takes the drama and character development element to a whole another level. What I am saying is imagine you eat a curry with extra spice and msg and if you like spicy curry like I do this adds that too, wouldn't that be awesome? Now first of all take a moment of silent and search this manhwa on google and see the art. Now if that doesn't give you an eyegasm please tell me what other manga or manhwa you have read because I have not found any competitor that can rival who made me a princess in term of its aesthetic and beauty. So yeah Character design is easily 10/10. Story at first glance seem like your typical isekai story, but as you go on I believe you will be super invested with it and realize how well-written and engaging the author makes these character to be because a big part of the story involves the character decision and outcome and of course like all good drama there is always a twist that is super heart-breaking just when you feel like everything is going nicely. So I'll give the story is a good 8/10 just because it is not fresh and original.

With full genuineness and a piece one-sided at certain things haha. And furthermore SPOILERS.. a tad The plot ain't unique by any means. Mc passed away, get inside the novel she read before dying and then trying to survive. I'm not a fan of Claude to be straightforward, I comprehend that he felt dishearten by his sweetheart dying yet come on... Is that even right? What on earth. His mindset sucks. I mean look at Gallahan of \"I will master this family\" He is literally a once in a hundreds years father as even when his lover died he still protect ... his daughter. Additionally, When Athanasia acted cutely in him that is the point at which he finally noticed her like omg I feel so bad for the fl argh Lucas, obviously, as a matter of fact, He's hot. (Abs reveal please jk). I'm fine with him getting together with Athanasia as they genuinely suits one another yet I hate how he didn't actually acknowledge that it's his issue that villain exist! Like being kind to individuals is truly simple so why do you have to do that! when he at last attempted to get revenge back at you, you're like \"How is that my fault?\" LIKE FOR REAL, once in a while, you must be the person who will be the one to adjust alright? Athanasia... I have no words. If I were her, I would most likely do the same thing she did cause I treasure my life and I'm not more smarter than her to think of other solutions haha. Anyways, overall. It's decent. Overrated as it is but I guess it's a safe choice if you like this. The story focus a lot on father and daughter tandem and cliche romance. So it's much easier to understand than other isekai manhwas that focuses on political issues. So yeah. That's it. Not on my recommendation, not on my favourites but read it if you want to lol.

Unfortunately, the ending isn't as great as the start of the series, which made me rate it 8/10 than more. Although the ending left me disappointed, I would still recommend it as ... Athanasia's journey was interesting to read about. If one seeks a reincarnation read, especially about a princess which also features drama, then Who Made Me a Princess is a perfect read."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Reborn with the knowledge that your own father hates you and wants to kill you – what do you do? The protagonist, Athanasia, decides to keep a low profile and one day flee the palace with jewellery. Unfortunately, she encounters her father, a tyrant and emperor, and is forced to play cute. Seemingly amused by her desperate attempts, he wants to see her more often. ‘Who Made Me a Princess’ is complete with 125 chapters – something that rarely happens and usually indicates that the author had to abandon the story for some reason. Here, however, it is truly complete, but unfortunately that still doesn't bode well. To ... understand my problem, you first have to answer a question: Why would anyone read a story like this? In my opinion, you usually start reading it because you want to see the (cute) father-daughter dynamic. And that's exactly what this manhwa delivers for the first 50 (?) chapters. But, unsurprisingly, a story has to be incorporated that isn't really interesting. What initially seems like one of many arcs to come, in which father and daughter grow closer while the emperor crushes envious nobles under his boots or destroys entire empires for his daughter, turns out to be an astonishingly lengthy and, as I said, rather boring story that I really didn't want to read. Honestly, it wasn't bad, but I just didn't want it. The manhwa promised me cute father-daughter dynamics and delivered them for over 50 chapters, so why on earth did it have to stop?! In fact, the work ends after this story is completed. The ending seems well-rounded, but ultimately it gives the impression that it was simply cut off in the middle, when I wanted to read so much more about the father-daughter dynamic. Conclusion: I can recommend this insofar as it is a fairly typical manhwa of its kind. Perhaps I am alone in my opinion, but unfortunately almost all manga/manhwa/manhua of this kind have the idiotic habit of incorporating a story after 50+ chapters and making it the linchpin of the work. Exceptions are rare and are among my absolute favourites (see, for example, The Beloved Little Princess). All in all, the characters here are still nice to watch, so I'm giving it 6 out of 10 potato points.

There are many, many cute moments between her and ... Claude, her father, as well as many angsty moments where his abject cruelty is not to be trifled with. The romance subplot is cute and subtle and moves not to overshadow the main plot. Its dock from a perfect score is a gripe that I have with many common isekais: how much does the isekai element play into the characters' interactions with the world? In a sense, she could have just as reasonably been written as a Future Athanasia reincarnated into her Past Self as a baby rather than her spirit being from an entirely different world, and the story would likely unfold the exact same. I'm more entranced by the question, does an adult isekai'd into a different baby truly see their new family as... their family?

Having just completed my 3rd complete read of available chapters I was really paying attention to why this work always left such a good impression on me. A standard that others within this sub-genre should aim toward. The quality of the aesthetics of “Who Made…” are self-evident, whether that be attractive characters, gorgeous backgrounds and panelling and a cute reverence for (at times) silly, yet fashionable clothing. However, I also believe that not only presentation, but plot and general character of the story is elevated here. The cast of relevant characters is kept ... rather small which seems to have given the plot ample time to flesh out and contextualise each individual persona. Not to diminish just how wonderful each miniature interaction in this story is. The bouncing tonal shifts in combination with the presentation just makes each scene pop in a way that the average manhwa in this sub-genre just doesn’t. It’s hard not to have a personal stake in the story from the very beginning because of this. You are sold from the first moments. The momentum takes you in it’s steely jaws and just carries you forward. There is no dilly dallying for pointless side character, or extemporaneous fan service. It’s all just baked into the core of the story. It’s all just dripping in high romance, as any fairytale should be! Not that this necessarily means it is without potential areas of irritation depending on taste. Magic has this ephemeral, nonsense quality to it. Lucas is very much the fairy god mother, who is plot designated as a possible auto-resolve button. A cynical (occasionally cunty) super-genius who always has the “logical” take and a suggestion that a flick of his wrist could solve all their problems (within some very loosely defined parameters). However, this is veto’d by the very story he exists within. Magic would be far too convenient a solution for us! Drama is what we serve. It wouldn’t be true to the emotional journey of either Athy, or even Lucus himself if it was all that easy. Not to suggest I don’t have any reservations with “Who Made…”, which I think gets a bit slovenly around the transition from first to second season. Amnesia is really not a solution I am entirely fond of for mixing things up. The story definitely makes the most of the scenarios that this offers up though, and having past that point quite a number of chapters ago now, I feel I can forgive the designer and appreciate what they have done with the place. Seeing the transitions from anhedonic stupor to blood thirsty beasts again for Claude is also entertaining. I would also be amiss to note that I don’t think I have seen a story (in this very specific sub-genre) give so much credence to it’s foundational premises. It has become increasingly common, with the supersaturation of these genre tropes, to simply discard the “I’m a 20-something nobody from IRL who has been reincarnated as a princess from a book, wowzers xD” and get on with the good stuff. But “Who Made…” makes a concerted effort to continue to incorporate the MCs past life into how she evaluates her relationships in her new life. Lucas is also in on the situation from the beginning, adding this extra layer of comedy to their relationship. There is even an increasingly obvious hint that there may be more going on behind the background. That the original “novel” wasn’t necessarily what it seemed. So I am highly impressed and think “Who Made Me a Princess” takes it’s side next to “Stepmothers Marchen” as the current standouts from this sub-genre (that I am aware of). This definitely reads more typical shoujo than “Stepmothers…” though, with it’s adolescent relationships and whimsical flare. I look forward to seeing how the story ends."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Isekai shoujo manhwa that adapted based on light novel.

If you love slow burn, you'll totally love the effort made by the FL to capture her ... father's heart.... their progressed relationship is the main story here, there's a male interest here as well but not as focused as father/daughter relationship, so don't expect romance here too much. Korean loves to use this \"kingdom\" setup unlike the \"school\" typical of japanese shoujo. One of characteristics of every isekai shoujo korean, you might love it if you're bored of a school setup. Art : One of the best aspect of this manhwa, the artist is very talented and detailed in drawing the characters. Character : The FL isn't the typical crybaby, she's kinda swag in her own way, but sometimes too oblivious to understand her father. The father is a tsundere. Overall both of them are not annoying or disruptive, their dynamic through the whole story is good and cute in some actions.

A struggle fantasy. [Villains are Destined to Die] is a story following a Korean woman possessing the body of Penelope. The villainess of a romance dating game. She has to struggle to survive and find a way to escape this world where no one is on her side. This is ... one of the more famous Otome Isekai, and one of the few to have gotten a physical release. It is well deserved (and I recommend it). It does however have some uncomfortable themes, such as putting down maids, and buying and exploiting slaves, so I understand if some readers find that to be too much. It also takes a long while before the romance gets going, so keep that in mind if you decide to read this manhwa. ▶Story: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The story kinda starts in media res, rather than at the beginning. I think this was a very good idea by the author, as this creates a far more compelling hook than if it had started at the very beginning. After hooking in the reader, the manhwa spends a few chapters jumping back and forth between present and past to give us exposition to what kind of person our heroine is, as well as what sort of romance videogame world it is she is being transported to. I did feel like it dragged on for a bit too long, but due to the significant role the setting plays in the story, you could argue that it is necessary. The protagonist is transported into the body of a villainess in a videogame set to hard difficulty with some very rigid game rules. She can only choose between 3 different dialogue choices and can not speak at will, with death being her reward if she makes the wrong choice. She is placed in some precarious situations, but with her extensive knowledge of the videogame from when she lived in the real world, she manages to navigate them without much danger to herself. This does not last, as she never finished the game in real life, and soon has to proceed without her cheat sheet. While this system of restricted dialogue choices is a novel idea that creates very tense situations, it wouldn't make for a good Manhwa story if the protagonist had that little agency, so after the introduction the restriction is dropped and it feels like the story starts for real. Another quirk of the world she finds herself in is that she can see how much someone likes her, on a score from 0% to 100%. Trapped in an Otome Game (A game where you typically control a female protagonist who has to win the hearts of one of several male suitors), she assumes that the way to escape might be to raise the affection score of one of them to 100%. The problem is that she has taken over the body of someone who is disliked by everyone, and any misstep might result in her death. It is a very tense story with all these systems working against her and she is forced to abandon her morality to survive. The allies she gains, she emotionally manipulates and exploits. She uses blackmail, lies and deceit to carefully craft a narrative to win the hearts of those around her and all this while her own mental health is deteriorating. The manhwa is really good at keeping the tensions high, and it has some really exciting story arcs. The court case being my personal favourite. There are some minor things I did not find that well executed in the story. In particular the heroine winning over the servants of the manor she lives in. It was jarring how quickly and easily she did it, and the story does not do a really good job at showing a smooth transition between everyone mistreating her and then everyone showering her with love and respect. In fact the story seem to backtrack a bit later with characters becoming mean to her again. This is not a deal breaker, but it did stand out a bit to me. ▶Setting: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ [Villains are destined to Die] is set in a fairly generic medieval fantasy inspired setting, with royals, knights, and magic. The nation that the story is set in is humorously named \"Eorka\". An anagram of \"Korea\". The setting is not that noteworthy, but the gameified systems that govern the world play a significant role in the story. ▶Characters: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The protagonist has well defined character traits and she experiences character development throughout the story. Though with the cruel setting she ended up in, that development is not always in the right direction. Her backstory is a tragic one and most readers will feel sympathy with her, or perhaps (but hopefully not) be able to relate in ways. She deserves goodness yet is put in a situation that is nothing but that, and she has to do a lot of bad to survive. Almost all of the secondary characters, the romantic suitors of the story are nothing but vile and/or tragic. Two faced characters who hide their true nature Ranging from callous and vying for her death, to emotionally manipulated and unstable. They all go through massive change throughout the story, but not all of it in the right direction. ▶Romance: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The romance is quite fraught with danger. The kind of danger where every romantic interest wants to kill the protagonist. Not the \"spicy\" kind of danger. It takes some time for the romance to develop and taking centre stage of the story because she has enough to deal with just trying to not be killed by them, and when the male lead presents himself, the dangers only escalate. It is not entirely obvious who the main character will be, but you will realise who it is before she does, and that can make it a bit distressing to read the path she is going down, but keep in mind that she is fearing for her life and how that can cause you to make poor choices. ▶Artwork: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The artwork ranges from decent to nice. There is very good use of colours and the artist manages to get feelings across well. The characters are decently drawn with some gorgeous outfits for certain characters, with extra effort seemingly put into the male leads. The backgrounds are not always nice, and while it fits the character's art style well, the ample use of 3D assets can make certain pages feel a bit cheap. Especially when there are graphical errors such as floating objects. Unlike most manhwa I have reviewed, I actually read the first few volumes of this manhwa physically, having bought the physical release. It looks marvelous in person. The full colour pages are great to look at and the comic layout is very easy to read. ▶In conclusion: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I am writing this review as of chapter 160 and all in all it is a classic otome isekai story. A fairly standard script executed extremely well with some small hints of psychological horror and uncomfortable topics. It features some of the tropes that haunt the Otome Isekai genre such as mistreatment of employees, and a near fetishization of slavery which bothered me quite a lot. In the context of the story it makes sense even if it can not be justified. It is a well paced story that has no troubles keeping the tensions high, and as of season 4, the story is building up nicely towards a climax in season 5, even if it will probably take another year or so before the story finishes, I think it is well worth the read right now."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Have you ever read a book or a novel written by a woman and thought \"I might have to go celibate for 5 years to compensate the amount of lust I've just read?\", well. look no further for a lustless experience.

Its about a girl who is transported to the Fantasy world of a game she played.

I read to the recent chapters and felt why am I not happy at all for the female lead. I did not understand why I felt like this and tried to reorganize all the events. Now I can say the female lead is a certified asshole. I am absolutely appaled and disgusted with how author handled the slavery in this work. It was truly beyond disgusting. Our beloved protagonist, started off with a bang, and chose to actively participate in slavery, purchasing a slave Ecles, with 1 000 000 00 Gold. Not only did you participite ... in this slavery and you made sure to pay enough profits (10 times at least) for people to expand this disgusting practice/operation, without any shred of regret. Throughout we are often exposed to female lead's emotionally abusive familly before reincarnation. And here we go, after purchasing a slave (who was a minor), she did the same emotional abuse, manipulative seduction as a slave owner to the Ecles. Mind you that she was 20 before reincarnation. On top of that, she wanted to tame the slave, to be his guardian. Safe to say that not only FL was a slave owner, actively participated slave trade, emotionally abused a minior, grooomed a minor using manipulative seduction. And I am supposed to take it as it is. Once I have realized this perspective, things were much clearer. \"But she did it in order to survive.\" - Oh so you are telling me, that in order to survive, it is totally ok for her to do the same emotional abuse, that she has been crying for the entire work, to a LITERAL MINOR SLAVE. No better gaslighting can be this delusional. By that logic, her family before reincarnation did nothing wrong then. \"But she thought it as a game \" - Oh yeah, the same game, that she tries her past pre-reincarnation experience to farm pity points, and so that she does the same digusting abuse to a slave without any shred of guilt. The same game, she tries to flirty flirty with an Prince NPC. Yeah, as I would believe that. It shouldn't weaponize real emotional trauma or expect us to empathize with her suffering. \"But she did good things\" - So what, if I save some people, does it give me an automatic right to abuse other person, not to mention participating the slave trade? This kind of thinking, is what I considere PURE EVIL. No one gets a moral get-out-of-jail-free card for selective kindness. What this author tries an attempt to make me sympathize with female lead but all it screams is : \"It is bad when others do it, but OK when I am doing it. It is ok when I involved a slave trade of a minor, it is ok when I emotionally abused him, manipulatively seduced him. My family before reincarnation are BAD people, but I am A GOOD PERSON, therefore I have this right.\" Now I know that every single word that female lead mumbles is a spit of hypocrisy, somewhat equivalent to cockroaches sound. Very funny thing is, when the slave decided do something for himself and decided to betray the female lead, the female lead, considered that it was because of her \"POOOR DECISIONS\" that has led to this. To frame a literal EMOTIONAL ABUSE ON A SLAVE as \"POOR DECISION.\" You are quite next level. So what we got is a groomer, slave owner, emotional abuser female lead that I am suppposed root? Nah, man I am praying for her downfall. AN ABSOLUTE VOMITING DEMONSTRATION OF ATROCIOUS WRITING."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Plot summary: An isekai story about a young girl transported into the body of video game villainess Penelope Eckart. Knowing the game mechanics, but not knowing the ending, Penelope must play the Otome game with the punishment of losing being death. Overall score: 10/10. This score admittedly has quite a bit of personal bias, but this isekai has the perfect 'isekai package' to it for me, especially compared to other isekai stories out there. With the world acting as a video game and each main male lead having a percentage counter above his head to show their affection toward Penelope, it ends up a great example ... of how an isekai may realistically be handled: you are not from this world and face real consequences (death) should you not play the world's game, and so you treat the characters with the intent to win. There are definitely moments that are not Penelope's brightest (i.e. her acting rather brash or scary at times), but even though she sees the world through a 3D lens now, she still sees the characters as mere percentage points. As such, she ends up treating some of the male leads as pawns in order to win the game. This is called a character flaw. Characters need flaws. Regardless, the story does excellently with having Penelope gain some introspection on her body's past -- she never lived Penelope's life, but must brunt the force of her prior actions through scorn and disappointment from others all the same, which makes for a very interesting flavor of angst. TLDR; an isekai treated well, with a female lead who knows what game she's gotten into. Read for angst, gorgeous art, literal quest windows, and an interesting reverse harem showcase."}, {"score": "6", "content": "For context, I read up to season 5 chapter 187 ish, where a lot of the mysteries have been answered. I will say this as someone who initially rated it a 10/10, don't get your hopes up. At the same time, it seems like my reading experience is vastly different from the other readers. The general flow of the story involves Penelope (mc) going against the flow and rejecting everyone due to \"injustice\" or \"why should I accept your apology\". While most readers seem to think that this is Penelope not conforming and standing strong for herself, I (initially) read it as an interesting story of ... an actually depressed person, constantly pushing others away, even when they have repented and want to help. The story does actually follow my interpretation to a point, where we can slowly see her life get worse due to her constant rejection of others. Then...... It takes a dip to the worse with the *redacted*, who pampers her too much. My main critique here, is how the story seems to think a person who is this depressed and anxious, should be helped. I believe Penelope should learn to overcome her trauma, and learn to accept others or learn to forgive, should learn that others are reaching out with an open hand. But nope! The story seems to think that she should not have to forgive or do anything! The others who wronged her in the past (even though she did too, in context) should grovel to her for the whole story and the way to solve the depression is just for someone to shower her with so much love that it breaks through her shell, not that she has to break it herself. Ps, she is also the type of person to say \"will you love me if I was a worm?\", and the solution is to say \"I will burn the whole world for a cure\" The other stuff like the art are pretty good, so I am willing to keep reading up to a point Tldr. Interesting start, but makes the mc too entitled (imo) without any self reflection"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Villains are destined to die is probably my favourite Villainess reincarnation story. It doesn't fall into the trappings of so many other stories within this cliche and is truly able to stand out in this saturated market. Story. The story is really interesting. It isn't the first Villainess story to involve death flags, but it's the only one which make the death flags feel like actual threats. The story also never lets you forget that this is part of a game.he only thing about the story that I'm not too fond of is the pacing, sometimes I feel like some scenes drag on for too long ... such as the festival scene, where it could really cut a lot of scenes. It's the same problem some other webtoon and manga have in which we have to read every single thought the characters is having, when they could just visual show it. I know this was original a novel, but I think that changing the medium should allow for some flexibility of what is shown in the manga/webtoon. Art. The art is good and consistent through out. I know some people don't like that the art isn't the same as the novel's cover art, but. I personally have no bias towards either art style. Both are really pretty. Character. I really love the characters. They all feel fully realised with very different personalities, and don't change easily like real people do. At least not most people. The Duke and the Maid are the two characters I don't really like. The Duke changes his attitude almost immediately and that just doesn't make sense and also is quite unsatisfying. The Maid also does a 180 being completely devoted and loyal to the female lead, which just doesn't make sense. And because these characters are important and show up a lot, I feel like it lowers it's rating a little. Enjoyment. What I really love about this story is that despite having the same scenes as cliche otome games, it always feels fresh. It's never boring nor does it feel like it's making fun of Otome Games.

If you read the webnovel of the series you know there will be so many things. For now, manhwa is still at the beginning, nothing really happened at the story.

It's something makes my day :D After I finished webnovel, I tried to read some of series like this one but i couldn't. It's definitely much more than a isekai, harem story. Penelope isn't like characters who just trying to ... marry the prince or taking the throne. She's thinking logical and trying to go back to her real life with every possible way. At some point she realizes it's a opportunity to discover herself and thinking deeper about her past. If you like strong and clever female characters, you'll absolutely like Penelope. Even male leads have deeper stories than other manhwa's ml. The art, characters, game's story, they're all created so beautifully. Definitely deserves a try!"}, {"score": "8", "content": "my review for this is admittedly biased considering i love the characters here for their aesthetics more than anything, but even then, i think this is a very good villainess story. the premise is simple: a university student gets dropped into a dating sim overnight, becoming a villainess who has an almost irredeemable reputation among her family. she's met with all kinds of decisions to make in order to turn her reputation around and gain favourability with the game's love interests, even if it involves the risk of death. it's nothing groundbreaking, but there's a lot of depth to the world and characters and the story ... is paced just right to keep things interesting even during less eventful chapters. as i mentioned earlier, i have a big soft spot for the characters. i absolutely adore penelope, she's a great protagonist with a lot of nuance to her character who comfortably fits into the role of a badass villainess. all of the love interests also have their own qualities that make them likeable and unique, although i do feel that some of them aren't as developed as others. as of writing this, the manhwa isn't completed, so i hope there are plans to flesh out these characters in the future. those who have had their time in the spotlight are brilliant though, especially kallisto who is by far my favourite love interest. story and characters aside, the art is gorgeous. it's consistently good and makes reading the manhwa feel worthwhile just for the pleasure of seeing these beautiful panels and character designs. i think this is definitely worth reading, it's really easy to get into and will only get better as the world and characters continue to be expanded. i'd easily recommend it to anyone who wants to sink some time into a delightfully drawn, addictive, and fun story."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I don't typically write reviews, and I've never wrote any for a manhwa or a manga but... This story has put me through a rollercoaster of emotions so I feel like I have to write something. As I'm writing this, the story isn't finished yet but it's reached its climax and I'm, again, unsure of what's going to happen next. The beginning of the story felt a little long and a bit similar to some other isekais. But each next event and each new chapter has managed to surprise me. I realized that most of what I predicted would happen, did not and I was wrong ... about most of the characters too. Maybe looking back at the story now, it all makes sense but the way the author has paced the lore and how they slowly introduced us to new information is outstanding in my opinion. Penelope, the main character is also such a well written villainess. Needless to say she isn't one of those characters that go wherever the wind blows. She is the wind or rather the entire tornado. She doesn't get swayed by the male characters easily. You can expect her to do the unexpected. I really enjoy her scheming and how often it feels like she's only one step away from kicking the bucket. The main male characters also have a pretty deep story as it turns out. Some more that others, but they'll definitely surprise you. I love seeing how the relationship between Penelope and her father has changed as well as his feelings towards her. The art is absolutely what motivated me to read this in the first place. It only gets better as the story progresses. The artist makes great decisions when it comes to colors to portray emotions and the atmosphere. The outfits are awesome and very creative as well. There's a lot of thought behind both visuals and every part of the lore. I haven't enjoyed a story so much in a very long time. It definitely stands out amongst all the other villainess isekai. The ability to keep me wanting to know more and more is something to be envious of, and I'm saying that as someone who works in media too. I'm a big fan, I hope Penelope survives and has a happy ending."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Even thought the villainess trope is kinda common and sometimes repetitive, I just love the execution in this one. I usually hate when people wake up in a game setting and they just become a new person and that's it, in this manwha is much more realistic the way she wakes up and it's like a game setting with missions, where at first she couldn't even talk, she only had a set of options and then how the relationships with the other characters develop is way more natural than I have read in some other stories. I also really like the fact that she is ... not completely different from the original Penelope, you can see she understands her situation and that makes the decision she makes a lot more coherent and not an instant 360 to how the original character was. It is very well written and the art is just beautiful, you can see how it gradually improves and the way each character and situation is actually really faithful to the light novel is greatly appreciated. I believe even though there is a \"harem\", the writer didn't make it so it wasn't clear who she was going to end up with, but you still can root for the other characters, not all of them get redemption and some are even darker than you expected, which means you can expect different things from this story, not just some happy fairy tale. So all in all, I believe it can be greatly enjoyed by most. If you like villainess, romance, otome games, drama and character development, then you will most likely be entertained by it."}, {"score": "8", "content": "What I love and at the same time I hate about this series: Penelope has no genuine relationship with any of the characters... At first, I loved it, because unlike most of the manhwas, she didn't accept this universe as her reality and tried to find ways to get back to her real world. Reading her monologues was fun. Until she bought that traumatized slave and started treating him like a dog... IT WAS SO PAINFUL TO READ. And I started really hating her after a part of the story. She neglected and made him obsessed with her. And when he started losing his mind, she ... mentally abused him and said him to kill himself using her superiority in their relationship. I think even though she was the protagonist of the series and meant to be \"the savior of the world\", she was really a villainess that not everyone can be fond of. But I still liked the story overall. The characters were really well written and even though you hate one character, you enjoy reading their scenes."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I am actually really surprised that I enjoyed this as much as i did and devoured over 180 chapters in a day. This is just actual peak, a masterpiece if you will. A lot of stories tend to drag on after a certain amount of chapters however this kept me invested all the way through and no chapter felt stretched or unnecessary at all. That in an of it self is an amazing feat!! Other than that the story is absolutely brilliant not even talking about the gorgeous breathtaking art! It is truly the blueprint for these kind of otome game reincarnation stories Penelope is honestly ... such a great character and very refreshing for this genre. She is very rational, logical, and she doesn't get swept up easily, which satisfies the reader and makes you feel for her even more because you can see how much effort she puts into every action and interaction to achieve her goal. A lot of heroines also tend to loose their \"touch\" trying to change the story/live happily in it/have a grand fairytale romance. Penelope stayed resilient and focused and it's great that she herself acknowledged her tendency to suppress her own emotions which gives her great depth and doesn't just make her seem like a tough cold female lead. You could really see her struggle, how she was never able to open up fully and how she was always on edge. But in this situation who could actually let go and feel their actual true feelings? I think anything else would have felt incredibly fabricated! This is such a subtle nuance that kind of creeps up on you and is only rarely talked about directly. That is also why her relationship with eckles alway felt so shallow and insincere, in my opinion it was kind of noticeable from the start that her original plan of the eckles-route wouldn't work out since at a certain point she didn't really seem to pay him much attention and he always was kind of an afterthought (she was busier with the other male leads) I never truly felt their connection and since she was emotionally detached the whole way through their \"relationship\" just never seemed like it could be a reality to me. That's why they could never reach 100%. I also really enjoyed how she handled her family and how she didn't forgive them and held them accountable later on. Even though it is now too late: the real Penelope is already dead. I think she did a great job of trying to take care of our beloved villainess in her own way and it makes me happy to think that a piece of Penelope's soul is with her. I truly wished the original Penelope would also get to experience happiness - alas we have to first get there \"this time\" since the story isn't over yet. I'm excited for the ending and wonder if we will ever get an interaction with the original Penelope. Lastly I would like to mention callisto who has somehow always been by her side and has accepted her for who she truly is. Their relationship development has felt uniquely natural and organic through their many different encounters. Until now I think Penelope has been too scared to truly accept her feelings and their relationship but with recent developments (ch. 184) things have been looking great. She is always able to be herself around callisto which makes her glow! He also sees her for who she is! THE SHIP IS SAILING I'M SO HAPPY Now after talking about the characters let's talk about the actual plot and story. This is an amazing story which has been building over the seasons ,steadily raising the stakes and uncovering more and more secrets of the world, to the final climax where we have arrived - even if we haven't yet found out everything - little hints have been strewn all over the story which makes for smooth transitions between different arcs as well as a plot and world that feels complete and thought out. This is all masterfully done and both the characters and the story have kept me hooked for 184 chapter and 9 hours! All the characters have a special place my heart (especially the duke and Emily + of course the main couple) which attest to a great delivery of each character arc and 3-dimensional storytelling which makes all the characters very round and woven into the story, it also makes them their own people who exist and take action even if they aren't \"on stage\" which a lot of authors tend to neglect. All these details come together beautifully to deliver this brilliant masterpiece which is one of a kind and dare I say, the blueprint I apologize if this is all over the place (it's almost 4am)"}, {"score": "6", "content": "I feel like this story had a lovely premise. I liked how the main character had a similar family situation to penny before she transmigrated. I couldn't handle the cruelty toward certain characters; humans by nature are hypocritical. I hate how she treats Eckles and barely acknowledges his existence. I understand her distain and whatnot from her previous experience when playing through the story via game. I feel like a lot of penny's family tries over and over to make it up to her and it is never met with reciprocation. She is a tragic character archetype, but it just isn't consistent. Her only goal ... is to gain, and nothing less. She never really creates meaningful relationships, rather just transactional ones. I believe that the idea of the plot could have been so much more; maybe I am just too into \"Happy endings.\" If you like angst and feeling terrible for all of the characters, this may be your cup of tea"}, {"score": "8", "content": "The story is very much a mixed feeling one; there are a ton of predictable moments, some exiting features and of course a good piece of morale advice that can be detected from it! There are amazing chapters which I've re-read several times. Which feel warm, engaging and exciting. The romance felt natural and lightheartedly clumsy, and rewarding. For example her interaction with Eckles showed a lot of signs of a character who didn't know how to love and court and probably didn't have a lot of friends in their life.; by buying things for someone and giving gifts is a common way of ... behaviour for someone who had a rough childhood and I was glad to see that included. These scenes demonstrated very well how unfamiliar she was with the world, romance and becoming genuinely close with people. At the same time it showed how desperate Penelope was to complete the game and get out. On the other hand Penelopes treatment of Eckles contracted very much this appease technique; instead of treasuring him like a lot of people in that position would do, she quickly cast aside Eckles, ignoring him until she got bored of the world. Then when she felt done playing with the other leads, then she came running after him again to gain favour. A lot of the time her character flaws are explained either as her trauma or because it's someone elses fault. Or because its a game so whatever can happen and she can act however without consequences. There is little growth for most of the characters but it is a good work if you want something light, attention grabbing and that you don't think too hard about."}, {"score": "5", "content": "This Manhwa had an interesting premise, which it abandons by chapter 10? 15? 20? I don't exactly remember, but roughly around that time, the idea that the main character is in mortal danger from one wrong move is gone. It devolves into a character drama, the point of which is… I'm not exactly sure. The protagonist doesn't seem to care enough about anything to commit to any one goal. She doesn't fix Penelope's life and relationships, she doesn't vent out her frustration at the situation, she rarely talks to her main escape vehicle, that is Eckles. She lacks character, therefore not being a character. “Penelope” ... fails at both kindness and manipulation. She is apparently so stoic as to not mentally crumble from being in mortal peril all the time, but she still chooses to yell at her brothers for being bastards to her. Why? I'm not sufficiently convinced she gives a damn about Penelope's life. Her only goal is apparently to get 100% favorability with a character to win, and she picks Eckles as her way to do so… and then forgets about him. There's one thing I can see her caring about, and that is to avoid the crown prince (even way after we as the audience know he isn't a danger to her). Aside from that ONE desire of hers, she has no actual motivations. Her inner mind is telling the reader otherwise, but I can see that she doesn't do anything of her own accord. She is forced into situations by circumstance or by literal quests telling her what to do. Never since the working class of Martinaise has the world seen such an inert person, unwilling to do the bare minimum to save her own life. Oh, and also I have to love the protagonist who falls face-first into being a manipulator, while not being able to read emotions WHILE HAVING A LITERAL INDICATOR OF LIKABILITY. Also, she is actually insane and has a slave, who she emotionally abuses. OF course, it's not even remotely framed as one of the most abhorrent acts of immorality man can commit. Also, the rest of the characters are hit or miss. Flip a coin each time a character interaction happens to guess the quality of it. Also, they're supposed to want her dead, but they really don't. Also, also, when it comes to favorability for her brothers, it makes no sense, once it crosses into 20%, they are already madly in love with her (romantically, of course. This is East Asia, baby, if normal incest is commonplace, step-incest is super normal, apparently.) But while being in love with her, they still behave like dickbags. The pink haired gremlin at least stops at just insults and later on genuinely tries to understand her feelings. The other absolute hobgoblin straight up betrays her and almost lands her under an executioner's axe. Somehow, I am supposed to not hate this person. Also x3, the pacing is shit. Penelope's very important birthday doesn't feel like a looming disaster if it didn't happen by chapter 50. It's chapter 124, the Third Season has ended, and it still hasn't happened. I don't know why I'm reading this. Anyway, although I've listed all the negatives and all the reasons you shouldn't read this. I personally enjoy the plot progression and some character interactions. It's moderately fun. Like 5/10 barely above dropping it altogether fun."}]}

Everyone is so supporting and no backstabbing within the main friend group. Obviously there has to be some little drama here and there but not as annoying as other webtoons. Enjoyment: I never stopped giggling or smiling while reading this. It's THAT good! This just made me feel ... so good and wholesome ever. I'm so sad when I reach the end of a chapter. Overall: What are you doing here still reading this? Start it immediately!"}, {"score": "7", "content": "Spirit Fingers. The story is about a shy somewhat unimpressive girl joining a group called the spirit fingers, where people of all ages are allowed to be in. This is her story of coming out of her shell and becoming her own person. With the help of everyone around her. The series starts weak honestly. The art isn't that impressive (massively changes for weird reasons as well). The comedy isn't that funny and somewhat repetitive. The characters motivations and they themselves aren't that enjoyable to watch either. This sort of shifts at around chapter 30ish. When we get to know more about the main cast, the characters personalities ... and generally the series overall becomes much more fun as more and more characters introduced. The drama surrounding certain characters is revealed in more detail. Throughout the series it just basically grows on you. I can't pinpoint the shift exactly. But suddenly the art style wasn't so bad anymore, the characters personalities weren't so annoying anymore and the comedy starting hitting more than missing. I think this is the gradual change that happens alongside the FMC. When she becomes more confident the series overall becomes more brighter. Its very enjoyable to watch her become the social butterfly from someone who couldn't even talk to other people. The series does such a great job of showing us that. I do think the side characters could use some work. The male lead especially wasn't really that likable. I mean he grew on me but much much later than everyone else. The side romances as well was done somewhat poorly. Like this series is a dating romance series and is able to show the tough part of being in a relationship. But at the same time you know it has the cliches that, my work is real important, im not good enough. But these aren't really that problematic either. I think i disapprove a bit of the message here. I like the fact that the female lead goes through this change. And i like watching her become something that she can be proud. But I don't like the motivation behind it. Yes the people you meet can change you. However this series feels like its saying that the people you meet are cool, exciting, ridiculous, overly friendly than yeah you too can be kinda social than before. As such the message gets a bit muddled. They help her too much and it takes that standing on your 2 feet away. Despite this she still grows herself so yeah. Some of the characters also just kinda disappear? Like they get removed from the series like Launch did from Dragon ball z. It's not that they are gone but more like the author forgot they existed. The series also drones on for like 30 chapters too long. Reading this series reminded me of Princess Jellyfish. Its another series where an incredibly shy girl comes out of her shell. The difference however is the fact that the writing in Spirit Fingers is just 100x smarter. And even though the pacing can be slow its not a fucking snooze fest The comedy is also slightly funnier. The romance is much much better. To me this is the series that Princess Jellyfish but falls flat on its face I think when tying up all the loose ends as well it could have done a much better job. It felt too easy and lazy. The characters also had these issues where everyone else was to blame but themselves. The son is a dick because the mom is a bitch because the father is an asshole because the company is tough etc. This is complete bullshit. Its on thing for the characters to feel this way. Its another for the author to show us and make us want to believe this garbage. It also has a comedic timing problem.. This is a big issue in every series but doesn't mean i won't mention it. The comedic timing is bad. When making a series discussion. I don't wanna hit with the lanky ass drawing about some stupid ass joke. Its an emotional moment let the scene past. Despite the issues i mentioned, I think the good part about this series outweighs the bad. The main message of this series is also clear. Though it does kind of hammer it in a little bit. TLDR Good series. Some issues but overall gets the message across and is entertaining enough throughout. Albeit with a weak start. 7/10"}, {"score": "9", "content": "GAH HOORAYYYYYY I FOUND MY 2ND GREAT UNDERRATED WEBTOON I READ THIS YEAR. I honestly thought the same that it was just about your usual nonsense of a love triangle story but heck I’m so glad I was wrong, it’s more than that dudes! It’s basically about a young plain 18 year old schoolgirl (Amy aka Babel) trying to find herself and meets a sketching group who go by their colour names. It’s just so great to see the character development among the group just makes you wanna fall for them cause they are all so adorable 🥰 I ship pretty much Kevin & Amy, ... Blue Finger & Green Finger, Khaki finger & Black Finger, among the rest I forgot to name but godammit they were all just wonderful together omg my heart!!❤️ This story made me laugh, cry, peed off, you name it!

The story is about a girl who lacks confidence - this stems predominantly from her life at home. She isn't treated equally to her siblings who are perhaps more intelligent. Upon joining a drawing club, she meets so many different characters. The story focuses on her growth as a person as she tries to find her passion. We see her build newfound confidence. The story is amazing. It's not overly dramatic but still manages to make you feel emotional when intended. The art style was unfamiliar to ... me, but I grew to love it. It's a comforting simplistic style, but there are a lot of moments where the art was intricate. The characters are what make the webtoon what it is. I've grown so attached to the lives of every character, side or main. We've seen almost every character develop, and I think anyone reading the webtoon would be able to resonate with one of the characters. To say I enjoyed this webtoon would be an understatement. I looked forward to every chapter, and I've reread it several times. It's a heartwarming story that doesn't try to be anything else."}, {"score": "9", "content": "You should read it, just read it. I'm surprised at the lack of reviews and hope its getting enough attention. Its funny, its cute, its emotional.

Although the romance is a huge part, it doesn't completely take over the story and pays the most attention to the characters and their journeys.

I definitely recommend, and plan to re-read sometime in the future."}, {"score": "9", "content": "This is not just a dum-dum feel-good manhwa. Spirit Fingers make you feel good about yourself. It is like a comfort to the judgy world of ours. It is a manhwa we needed. While most manhwa provide escapism, this manhwa encourages you to stop what you are doing and chill for a while. Do something you like , have fun even if you are not good at it. Be confident and be strong about it. Choose your color, define your color and be your own color. ** Other Information about this manhwa: Is the story unique? If it was predictable, did you enjoy it anyway because you like this genre/set-up? It ... has its uniqueness and sometimes it may be predictable but it's not that big. It feels like every scene and event falls perfectly as if it was the correct piece in the puzzle. Do you think the art style is fitting for the story? Yes. I could not imagine any other art style than this. It emphasizes the simplicity of everyday life and the fabulous artistry of their escapism. Were the characters well-rounded? Did they have flaws and strengths, or were they unusually strong/smart/stupid? Character wise? Yes, they are well-rounded. They have their own flaws, strengths, and insecurity. Although we do have main character for this story but this did not fail to show other characters to have their lives outside their circle. They do not just live their life around MC but they live their life -- in the real world. Did the characters react to situations and events in a realistic way? Yes. I'd like to point out the scene between the mom and Baby Blue. When we want to take our chosen path, we would reach out to our parents \"Hey, please support in doing this.\" It is rare for a parent to say \"Okay, go ahead. pursue your dreams\". Most of the times, especially in an Asian family, the parent would disagree not because they don't trust you but because they want you to have a secure future in a field where there is no shortage of work. The mom of Baby Blue knew that and that's why I feel like she was stricter with Baby Blue. Do you think others will enjoy/dislike this series, even if you didn't? Why? I feel all good things in this series that's why I loved it. Most of the times, it lifts me up more when I read this manhwa. So I hope that it could receive all the love that it needs.

I tried picking it up over and over, but i couldn't get past 10 chapters. Now that I'm reading it as a conscious adult, i still found it boring in the beginning, but after i got past chapter 20 the chemistry of FL and ML started to show, then as i kept going, more and more i found the story really cute and wholesome. I think it was around chapter 100 when i couldn't stop reading, because of the way ... every chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and it's so seamlessly continuous to the next chapter, unlike in the early chapters where it would just end like episodic skits, you can tell the author became mindful with the control of the pacing. I also love how as you read through the 2nd half of the story, gradually the scale gets bigger and starts expanding on the other characters, but it didn't seem like a lot to take in because the author paid attention to the divide of screentime, so it didn't seem like the other side plots took over the spotlight of the main story. Art is really cute and simple, but if it's about spirit fingers or ML it's so sunshine and rainbows. I bet the artist studied or maybe took a lot of references in fashion because it's so amazing to see the poses and bodyline of each character.

{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/8586/The_Breaker", "reviews": [{"score": "10", "content": "This manhwa is one of my favorites. I started reading it and within a day i was finished and wishing there were more chapters out. so i read it again. Story - 9 The story starts out like so many other fighting manga or manhwa with a kid whos a little different getting picked on by a bunch of bullies until some adult teaches him some moves. While not starting out very unique it becomes a story about much more than. You start seeing a whole new world that was hidden to normal people that Shi Woon is stepping into. One of the good/bad things about this ... particular story is that it starts off a little slow, so it may take a few chapters to get into. I say this can be a good thing because it feels a bit more realistic plus it really builds up your anticipation and when it does take off it doesnt dissapoint. Art - 10 F*cking amazing. Character - 10 this is where it really shines in my opinion. There are so many interesting characters and they are all so different. Plus they really really develop during the story and i can tell that at this point of the story theres still much more they can achieve and its really exciting for the reader. Characters who start out being there mostly for jokes have a much darker history and really get to show you how integral to the story they are. One of my favorite character relationships in this manhwa is the protagonist Shi Woon and his rival So Chun Hyuk. The first time they meet each other changes both of their lives by so much, and at the risk of giving anything away ill stop there. very cool. Enjoyment - 10 There are quite a few spots in this manhwa where i stopped reading and reread the same few pages a few times over before continuing. The whole story was just a lot of fun to read, and i cant wait to read the rest of the chapters as they are released. Overall - 10 This is the kind of story that makes your friends mad at you for introducing to them because they cant stop reading it. Its a perfect blend of comedy, romance, and most of all action. Highly recommended."}, {"score": "5", "content": "The short version: If you've ever experienced any modern day asian martial arts drama, you have already experienced The Breaker. Unless you're fan of the genre, there isn't really a reason to read it. The long version: The Breaker is a bit weird manga-manhwa hybrid. It's made by Korean authors, it's released in Korean magazine by Korean publisher and yet it's made to be read right to left, as a regular manga would be. While I don't know what the reason for this decision was, just be check if you're reading it the correct way if you're getting confused. The reading direction isn't the only odd, crossbreed thing ... about The Breaker though. So is the art and in a way, the story. Most of the story is a regular one - weak protagonist gets bullied at school and a chad teacher takes him under his wings, GTO-style. Another cliché follows - the protagonist is given an insta-power up item that makes him strong for basically no reason other than the plot progression. Enemies starts popping up and fights ensue. MC also gets big angery when someone close to him is in danger. Now this is where it gets to the weird part - even though it follows the classic setting for the zero to hero story, the role The Breaker's protagonist fulfils most of the time is... a punching bag. Against every enemy. Even after he gets strong. Even against folks much weaker than him. MC's go to strategy is to get beaten, get up, recieve more beating, get up, repeat, shock the opponent with getting up numerous times and then the fight gets resolved somehow. No joke, this is how most, if not all, fights the protagonist is part of go. Ultimately the story just opens a bag of martial artists, throws them at the \"good guys\" and is like \"Yo fight those, coz reasons\". The conflicts are explained with the martial arts equivalent of technobabble. I've noticed that some people are writing about \"amazing plot twists\", so let me warn you beforehand - there are none. And by that I don't mean the the plot twists are weak or predictable. I mean that the story has nothing that could be called a plot twist. One thing I really liked is that at one point in the story, a character acknowledges that even the strongest martial artist will die if they get shot. Which was nice until I realized this makes one of the core setting void. You see, in The Breaker, the \"civilians\" and the martial artist societies are separated, as mixing would result in conflict and martial artists are way too overpowered for the regular world, at least that's how it's explained to as. What isn't explained though, couldn't the police just shoot them if they start making too much ruckus? Now, for the art - especially at the start, the illustrations of The Breaker look like shoujo artstyle trying to fit shounen story. Main characters are bishounen, the background is plain and the character frequently break into chibi forms or \"typical anime reaction faces\". Which, as you can imagine considering the main genres of The Breaker, disrupts the atmosphere. It breaks The Breaker. As with the badly timed comical relief, the series also suffers from intrusive fanservice that serves no purpose. Well, yes, fanservice usually serves no purpose other than being a fanservice, but this setting is an especially bad place for it. Luckily, the art issue gets better and as you're getting through later volumes, there are less and less missplaced \"funny\" faces and fanservice. The art itself also gets better and particulary in the last few volumes some very well drawn pages can be seen. Overal, The Breaker is just a mediocre martial arts story that isn't exactly bad, but also isn't exactly good."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Following our protagonist, we are taken through the vast world of a secret martial arts society, the Murim; where the top of the food chain are the strongest practitioners of martial arts. The general plot of this manwha seems to be linear, hero vs villain, hero pulls through in the end; yet there are many surprises. The art and character development are lacking in finesse, but are made up with strong emotion and iron-clad wills.

This Manwha had me up from 11:30pm all the way to 6:00am!. I'm sure you have all had some sort of anime or manga that has kept you up through the night, making your eyes betray you forcing your eye lids to close as if your eyes were pulling the curtains down, ... shutting out the light telling you to sleep. BUT!, all of a sudden a new character or plot develops snapping those eyes back into action. The Breaker is one of those things. Story: From the very first chapter the story had my eyes glued to my Ipod ( Yes i read manga / Manwha before i go to sleep on my Ipod. ) making my brain force my fingers to swipe the screen down to advance the story, and i gotta say during the entire time i was reading \"The Breaker\" i had a smile plastered on my face. I'm not a Veteran when it comes to judging stories, considering i haven't read much Manga / Manwha but i can't deny that i enjoyed the story immensely. Art: The Artwork can be described in just one word. A Masterpiece. Well...Two words >.> and it only gets better and better as the Artist grows familiar with the Protagonist and the antagonists of the story. Character: The protagonist Yi, Shi-woon goes through amazing character development and there is absolutely 0 dull moments when following the Protagonist and same with his fellow companions. The synopsis already tells you the basis of the story ( If you are reading this review without reading the synopsis, Read the synopsis then come back -_- ) and Chun-Woo is exactly the same 0 dull moments with him. Same can be said for Lee Shiho. Enjoyment: Look i read about 50 chapters from 11:30pm - 6:00am and i gotta say the entire time i just had a smile plastered on my face and even while waiting for the bus to go to school i was smiling remembering all the hardships the Characters went through and no anime or Manga / Manwha has done that to me before, so yeah 10/10 for enjoyment and when i finished all the 72 chapters i had an even bigger smile on my face knowing that there was a Sequel. Overall: I'm gonna keep it simple. 10/10 by far my favorite Manga / Manwha and i know i cant compare a Manwha / Manga to a anime but in terms of enjoyment it surpasses a lot of anime, if not all.

Coming up with cool martial arts moves is in so many wuxia dramas, it's really nothing special. 4/10 --- Mild spoilers --- The disciple here is easily the most annoying protagonist I've ever seen in any manga - courage and intelligence are not mutually exclusive, and not knowing when to back off can backfire so easily if not for the copious amounts of plot armor equipped by the protagonist. Unlimited spirit = \"You cannot keep me down!\"? Just break his legs and move on, kid ain't Wolverine. And when people are trying to save your life, please stop ... trying to throw it away. Let's not forget how hypocritical he was when he stops his master from killing someone that offers up his life, but then proceeds to almost kill another person when his friend was threatened. I'm sure some people would defend him \"He didn't know how much strength he was using\", but as far as I know, a concrete smashing fist is pretty lethal when applied to a human head. Art: Why are the women unnecessarily sexualised? That's not usually an issue to me, just another problem in a multitude of issues this manga faces. The chibi drawings are overly used, jarring, and almost seems to be screaming \"Laugh now! Look, the atmosphere and tone has changed, I'm making a joke!\" Fight scenes are a mess and moves are really just the same, no matter how many names you come up with - huge burst of ki or speed. Plot: What plot? Let's conveniently forget all about the pill the disciple consumed, even though it's exceedingly rare.

Case in point 'The Breaker' is a Manwha which is a Korean manga and a Manhua is a Chinese manga, just so you know what those mean, now TO THE REVIEW. The Breaker, at first, looks like it's going to be one of those bully revenge stories, but thank Christ it wasn't, it's about (correct me if I'm wrong) the world of underground martial arts and what happens when people who have apparent monstrous amount of Ki fight. I only thought Ki was the fundamental ... part of Buddhist medicine and that one martial art I've forgot (Good job brain), But if you can manifest Ki the way they do in the manga.... I want right now. To the art, it's really fucking good, the time and effort that someone put into it is evident, from the comedy moments where everyone looks like those chibbi vinyl figures you can buy, to the moments when the person speaking is getting serious, and when someone gets REALLY. FUCKING. ANGRY. At the end, the art just brings home the same feeling that those in the actual manga would be feeling, the sense of \"I really do want to be near this guy right now.\" The characters, okay at first I thought the teacher was a dick but he turned out to be alright, the student filled the role of \"Guy who has potential and doesn't know when to quit.\" really well and that nurse chick was also kinda fun. I am willing to say that The Breaker is probably my favorite manga to date, above even Tokyo Ghoul and people who know me know I LOVE Tokyo Ghoul. Also this manga probably has one of the single best ending arc's ever, wrapping up most of the problems presented while setting up for the sequel The Breaker: New Waves (Go read it if just as good if not better). If I had to nit-pick the one thing I didn't like was the fact that the student didn't really have a love interest, I mean there was a girl that he obviously cared for but the lad didn't even get a kiss, a minor thing compared to the rest of the manga though. So if you have a spot for a action-martial-art-finding-oneself manga The Breaker will most definitely scratch that itch. Goodbye me brethren, see you in the next one."}, {"score": "6", "content": "As everyone's saying, the art is amazing. It can be a little hard to follow exactly what is being drawn sometimes during the fight sequences because they are drawn very roughly to give a sense of speed and weight to the movements - which is great, but ends up being very puzzling to figure out if it's a head or a foot or how a character ended up in bum-fuck nowhere. As for the plot. It's so stupid, it's so fucking dumb. First of all, the romance between Shiho and Goomoonryong is so forced it's laughable. They start off as barely interacting with eachother in any ... way other than by being absolute assholes to each-other; they have no chemistry whatsoever and end up being rushed into a relationship, like, just before they get to the last place in the manhwa. It's a mess. Yes, Shioon hints at Goomoonryong having a thing for Shiho, but it's clearly stapled on right before they get together that it's obviously a contrived way to give any sense of foreshadowing to them liking each-other in any way whatsoever. It's also repeated a million times right before the final showdown and during it that Goomoonryong doesn't know how to express his feelings as an effort to desperately try to give an explanation to them getting together. An explanation as thin as tissue paper. I only bring up that romance sub-plot because it's the main fucking reason for the story turning out the way it did. If they didn't become \"lovers\" right at the end, Goomoonryong would never go full Berserk-mode with the Black Origin Threshold bullshit and punch Shioon's fuckin' ki-center lights out. They could have done so much more with it that it's honestly sad as fuck. It's so well drawn, it's jaw-dropping at moments to look at the amount of effort put in every single page. But the story doesn't hold up. To wrap it up, with my biggest gripe. Why in the name of everything holy did Shiho - who presumably was in on the plan since the start even though it never looked like they had a plan until Alex showed up - give the fucking 'dan' to Shioon? Why?! If she hadn't done that NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED! Three of those miraculous fucking dans were stolen, but by the looks of it she only got one of those because she didn't give any to the little fucking kid, Sosul, that had the exact same problem as Shioon had with the blood vessels or whatever the fuck they decide to translate it to this time! It makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE! Unless my brief hiatus between Vol. 2's beginning and the rest of the whole manhwa made me forget some crucial fucking shit. The only way that it makes sense is if they got there with no plan and when they finally got together decided to draft a plan that only happens after the disciple swallows the dan! They really must have been kicking themselves \"Ah fuck, we should have come up with this before I gave it to that kid for no fuckin' reason. Oh chucks!\" BUT WAIT A MINUTE! They only got recommended to be teachers at that school because the fucking PRESIDENT recommended them, but the fucking president of the school was DEAD. So presumably they had to have killed him and faked the recommendation, SO THEY MUST HAVE HAD A PLAN SINCE THE START! WHAT KIND OF FOOLS ARE THEY?! TO LIKE THIS STORY YOU GOT TO ACCEPT THAT THEY ARE ALL STUPID, IMBECILE, MORONIC BUFFOONS! Unless I have some sort of amnesia, I honestly don't know how anyone can like this story. It's riddled with plot-holes. Like, why didn't they, after pretty much finding out that Shioon's blood practically resurrected Sosul, give some of his blood to help Goomoonryong heal that fucking ARM CAST! It was there for so long it seriously aggravated me. Anyway, in conclusion, it could have been much better and unless I really missed some obvious shit, it doesn't make any logical sense at all. They must all be absolute chimps or the plot doesn't work. I'm actually gas-lighting myself because I don't trust that I didn't miss some important shit that would have made all of this come together. I just refuse to believe it. It was such a massive letdown when it started off so well. I give it a light to decent 6 (mainly because of the art). Tran- -sition. Have you given this manhwa a read? Did you love it did you hate it? What would you rate it? (this last Anthony Fantano bit is just a goof to help me forget how disappointed I was with this manhwa)"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Special Note - This is a Korean \"Manhwa,\" meaning it is created in the style of a Manga, but it is not a Japanese series. The names are Korean in large part, but the main character's master is actually named after a famous school of Muay Thay martial arts, which is a style popular in Thailand. Story - 10/10 The Breaker was a total breath of fresh air for me. It starts out like a typical shonen, with a young high-school boy being thrown into a dangerous world of super-human warriors, but the story takes many unexpected turns. The point-of-view shifts between the master and his apprentice, ... each with their own unique story, and each being equally pushed to their limits. I loved this format, and it made much more sense than ignoring the master and having the apprentice somehow out-shine a godly martial artist in less than one year of training. The story is dark at times, darker in fact than the most popular shonen around today, and I really loved the tension this created. We knew that good guys could actually get seriously injured or die in this series. The writer wasn't willing to give anyone a \"plot shield,\" and this made everything much more dramatic. The love stories in this series are actually rather good, especially considering the limited panel time, and I never felt like it was fake or rushed when two characters showed that they had formed a connection. That isn't a critical element for a shonen series, but it did make some of the fights more emotional, especially the finale. Finally, this story directly connects to the sequel, The Breaker: New Waves, which has been great so far. I recommend checking out the sequel after The Breaker. Art - 9/10 The fighting is really interesting in this series. It's mostly hand-to-hand, but the artist keeps it fresh between each fight by introducing new moves or new styles. The choreography is just amazing, and never got stale. Every new fight had a new feel to it, even rematches between the same fighters. Unique martial artists have their own styles, and people from the same house/clan have similarities. This is very well-done in general, and I was always excited by the action. The backgrounds are decent, nothing special in that regard, but adequate. I've seen better, but also much worse. The character designs were excellent though. Everyone looked completely different, there were no generic guys, even among the fodder. I loved this attention to detail. The design of Shi-Ho Lee is just spectacular, and it matches her personality perfectly. Characters - 10/10 I think the characters are much deeper than what you see in shonen series most times. We have 4 key characters. Shi-Woon Yi is the perfect \"coward to hero\" archetype. I wish more stories had boys like this. He's your typical shonen hero, but his fear and deep anger are much more believable than what I usually experience in shonen series. The story is mostly about his growth into manhood, but other stories emerge as he explores the martial arts world, and the story becomes about something much bigger than one boy's life. Chun-Woo Han is the perfect warrior, a monster feared by even the greatest masters in the martial arts world, but he's left that all behind to foolishly pursue a teaching career. Inevitably he gets lured back in as his story intertwines with that of Shi-Woon Yi. He's not just a mere mentor, and Chun-Woo Han plays an enormous role in the story. At times, he feels like the true main character. Jin-Ie Kwon is a great character. She's a strong girl that doesn't need to be saved all the time, but at the same time she is far from totally free. Her suffering stems from her position within the Sun-Woo Clan, one of the strongest martial arts houses in the martial arts world. Because of her obligations to her father, she often does what teenagers do, running away from their parents and living rebelliously. She saves Shi-Woon Yi many times, and is a serious bad-ass when angered, but no match for Chun-Woo or any of the true masters of the martial arts world. Shi-Ho Lee is an elegant warrior, not quite on the level of Chun-Woo Han, but a serious elite capable of fighting nearly anyone in the martial arts world without so much as breaking a sweat. Shi-Ho Lee is a stunning beauty, she has a great sense or humor, and a strong aura of confidence surrounds her. I particularly loved her relationship with Chun-Woo Han, and she is an unforgettable character. Enjoyment - 10/10 I loved this story. It had everything you could possibly ask for in an action series, and then some. Every arc was emotional, every character felt unique, and the fights were all absolutely thrilling. Overall - 10/10 This is an emotional story, and you will be moved by the events that unfold. If you want a light-hearted series that simply makes you feel good every week then you should look elsewhere, because The Breaker is a roller-coaster ride. I am currently reading the sequel, which has been very different so far, but has improved greatly and may eventually rival the original."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Has to be one of the best manhwa's i ever read!

I wanted to read a new and interesting manga and I found this. I was instantly hooked. The brutal violence brought the story further than any shonen manga I have ever read. I soon began to love the characters, the amazing art and everything about it. This manga entails a boy who is bullied so much that he wants to choose death over life. However, he is saved by his Teacher and this teacher changes his life. This \"normal teacher\" is nothing more then one of the greatest martial artists ... of all time. He finds this out when his teacher is going around picking up girls at the club. He is soon captivated and begs to be trained. This is where the story begins. The art is nothing more then amazing with the swift stokes of ink scattering the page to the riveting pages of violence. This manga is unanimously entertaining but it is more then that. It is a personal and lovely journey into the world of a sad child who only wants to protects the one he loves.

Although there are elements from this main character shared from Kenichi, the art and darkness this author dishes out rises it to a completely different level! If you read History's Strongest Disciple: ... Kenichi, but you thought it was too happy, please read this manwha! It rips your heart guts out just to feed it back to you.

The Breaker is a manhwa that follows mostly 2 people, Yi Shi-Woon, a highschool boy who is very week, frail, cowardly and is under constant bullying and Han Chun Woo a recently transfered professor who is a \"ladies man\". In truth, Han Chun Woo is actually at the school on a mission, he is apart of the murim, a secret world of martial arts and when Yi Shi-Woon sees who Han Chun Woo really is, he asks him to be trained so that ... he can stand up to the studants who bullie him. The story branchs of from this 2 characters, other characters eventually show up, all very unique and a brand new world opens up for Yi Shi-Woon. Aside from the amasing plot that takes awhile to develop but once it starts it really gets you interested in the manhwa, the art work is fantastic. The character designs, the backgrounds, its all so well done that the manhwa kept me drooling all over it. The character themselvs as stated previously are all very unique and each have their own personalities and are very memorable. As you can see from my fanboy'ish review, i loved reading this masterpiece, i enjoyed it so much i read all 72 chapters in one day, and on the next day i went back and read it again in 1 day, thats how much i enjoyed this manhwa. I definatly recommend The Breaker(and its sequel wich is still ongoing atm) to anyone who likes a good story with interesting characters and huge character devolopment, great art work and epic martial arts technics. I hope you enjoy it as much as i did, and thank you for spending the time to read this Review."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Now it has been a while since I’ve read The Breaker, so I’m sorry if I won’t stay strict to details. Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt this manhwa series is one of the best in martial arts genre. I’m sure I’ll have a 100% support by saying that. Indeed it’s a very high level manga, that may interest not only fans of seinen and action genres but all the manga lovers as well. Starting with the storyline, I can say that it is pretty simple, but interesting and unique at the same time. Nothing special, still not boring, and the ... plot is able to surprise you a couple times. The story is set in our real world that authors show from the other hidden side. The martial arts federation is the most dominant secret group with powerful and destructive force, that runs society, while staying in the shadow and can make any country’s government bend their knees before them. But who is the real villain is yet to be known… When we’re talking about the art style, all I can say is – great. This is probably the best manga art style I’ve ever seen so far. Everything is very detailed and I’m not talking about characters only, the background is also paid much attention to, so you can easily see the picture of the authors’ world. And though nowadays almost every manga series is been drawn using computer, that allows to draw particularized illustrations easily, The Breaker still deserves to be praised. I’m not even talking about the design of female characters, who look like flawless angels. Each of them! The characters. Well, the main protagonist is nothing but a cliché – a week, unable to protect himself, still with strong will and good heart, trying to overcome everything that life throws onto his path. Constantly seeking the way to become stronger, he eventually finds it in the face of his new English teacher, who happens to be something more than meets the eye. And so their adventures in the world of martial arts begin. The big advantage of Breaker series is that there are almost 2 dozens of supporting characters who are very multifarious and have a great impact on the storyline (much more than our main hero) and that’s the reason of why it is so interesting to read. The enjoyment that I’ve received reading this novel is insane. May be that’s because I did recognize myself in the face of the main character and because I’ve experienced what he did, but I personally enjoyed this manga very very much, especially saying that it’s really easy and fun to read. The Breaker has forever taken its place in my top manga list, and I absolutely recommend it to every anime/manga fan. Great work!"}, {"score": "8", "content": "I don't know, but korean manhaw's are pretty heavy in portraying the dark themes especially the bullying in the beginning. Compared to Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi the Breaker is much heavier. If you liked this manga you'll probably like Feng Shen Ji. Anyways, i think the story line is fanstastic i give it a 9/10 (but only for the first part up until The Breaker: New Waves). Though the death of Shiho was saddening it was understandable and very well done, her death also allows the reader to sympathise for Han as he turns to evil in New Waves. The art is good i give ... it 9/10 because I personally like the art style, but usually art come down to interpretation so at worst i think its an 8. Character development is good 8/10, Shi-Woon starts out a whimp then becomes brave and somewhat strong. Even the little romance between Sosul and Shi was alright."}, {"score": "8", "content": "First of all, I really enjoyed reading this manwha (Korean manga), Its a bit like reading Bleach (only without the supernatural/ super power element to it) and I think its good enough to be animated like Bleach has been (although its a Korean manga so maybe it'll jump from animation to live action instead? There have been many korean live action dramas recently Like City Hunter and Playful Kiss that were originally manga/anime and have been turned into Live Action dramas in Korean so one can only hope that this could be the case with The Breaker) :P *ahem* The story: Brilliant. The pace was good ... and it wasnt just about the three main characters, often it was about the society these characters lived in and how devious and dangerous it was. I liked how the artist/Author was able to create many difficult situations for the characters and it was so detailed that you could well imagine something like this happening now in the real world, which i think is awesome :P Also the Artist/Author knew exactly how to bring in empathy for their characters and I'm sure everybody else will think \"How Awful!\" during the time they read it too which is an accomplishment I think because some manga artists try to get you to sympathize with the characters but end up failing. This time, it was a success. ^^ The Art: Very well drawn and detailed enough that you could almost imagine the characters coming to life lol It wasnt just the characters that were wel drawn but the surroundings too so you could really picture the scene in your mind :P The Character design: Well one of the main characters was a bit of a perv at first, always chasing after 1 woman and another main character was always teasing the guys but then suddenly half way through they fell in love with each other and stopped being like themselves as the reader had gotten to know them has..... Maybe it was the situations they were put in but I guess i didnt like the \"Abruptness\" of the sudden changes of personality/actions of these characters but it was still interesting to read, i dont think this ruined the manga at all :P My overall enjoyment was pleasant, i just couldnt stop reading it until I got to the end (Which was so disappointing im glad the artist decided to do a sequel called New Waves ^^) There was plenty of action, martial arts, comedy/drama, it stuck well to its genre, overall it was very, very good! I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Bleach and Naruto as its just as good as their are and has similar genres so they wont be disappointed :P"}, {"score": "8", "content": "I dont like the story so much I dont think its special the art is so great the characters are fine the enjoyment I give him 9 which make the overall 8 ^^ (7.5)"}, {"score": "10", "content": "To me, The Breaker is the best action title on this site. (I got a TL;DR for each paragraph btw) Art TL;DR - The art is damn good. The martial arts are stylish. SSStylish! If you will. It speaks for itself but it takes a few volumes to hit that 10/10 level. Getting to the point, the main appeal of the series is the art while it does take a few volumes improve to the standard of the rest of the series. The character designs are well done because they often echo the character's personality e.g. Hyuk So Chun is a character who is for all ... accounts perfect as a martial artist. Both his character and appearance are simple yet refined and perfectly orthodox. The backgrounds are sparse at times but, that sparseness is sometimes used to have the focus of the panel be squarely on the action and when there is detail in the backgrounds and especially the cars the art is top notch. The choreography and panel flow really shines and is what makes the series what it is, makes the action parts feel smooth and sleek and it's very easy to follow the flow of the fight which a lot of shounen manga sometimes fail to do. Story TL;DR - The story has more to it upon rereading but on the surface it still does a good job of facilitating the martial arts action without being needlessly convoluted. The story seems simple enough on the first read and with its fast pace it makes it an easy read where the story doesn't take away from the action and facilitates it well. Upon rereading, especially after reading the sequel, you can really appreciate how the story sets up multiple sub plots relevant in both this series and the sequel. A lot of the things that would usually be a problem aren't because it makes sense in the context of the story. without spoiling anything, there are parts of the story where it seems like the writing has taken a shortcut and leapt forward to progress the plot but the reasoning for it makes sense when considering the context of the overarching plot and why the situation is how it is. Also the story balances focus between the subplots, MC and his teacher well to a point that the plot remains engaging, it's never too much of the same. Characters' TL;DR - The MC develops nicely thanks to pacing and the fact that we see each turning point in his character, the teacher Chun Woo is just a solid cool guy and the supporting characters are solid albeit some are left a bit shallow. The characters are much like the story, facilitating the story at a glance but having a good level of depth and development upon a closer look. The MC Shi-Woon is comparable to Midoriya (Boku no Hero academia) and Kenichi (History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi) being a weak ass kid who was bullied and then picked up by some of the strongest people in the world. His development is more solid however. the do-gooder aspect is still there in prime shounen fashion but, seeing where he came from emotionally one can see why he feels that way. There's a part where he says he wants to learn martial arts to protect himself and the people he cares about but unlike the aforementioned protagbags, you get the sense that it's because after experiencing that constant fear and feeling powerless to a point he'd consider doing anything to get a break, he wants to stand up for himself and be nice to everyone because he wants to distance himself from how he was and how his bullies are as much as possible. The teacher, Chun Woo, is a loose cannon but his backstory explains his reckless attitude and his soft side and it gets to a point where his story is as engaging, if not more than, Shi-Woon. Supporting cast is good too but this is long as is. Wrapping this long ass review up, I gave it a 10 because the art in its entirety is top notch and the writing goes along to fit with it making it feel like a complete package. The art is the stand out aspect of the series but the story and characters are still good, in fact I give the writing even more credit for being good without drawing focus away from the main appeal of the series.

What I mean by that is that each new 'arch' follows a similar pattern, with the same beats and plot details, but each one furthers a very clear linear pathway toward the conclusion. Unlike stories like the big three this story is very clearly bringing us to a conclusion and each loop is simply a means to make us care about the world and characters in order to make that conclusion feel more impactful. And in that regard, this story ... shines, it has a solid set of likeable characters that gain depth as you progress and are mostly well developed. Its hallmark however is the story's message on bullying and peer abuse. I have never seen a story handle this issue in a more relatable and realistic fashion. The writer and artist clearly were holding nothing back in their depictions, and did not hold anything back when expressing how horrific these kinds of situations can become. Now, while it is unpleasant to think about, it is important to discuss and the creators should be commemorated for being willing to have that in this manwha. Art 6: The art for the most part is quite fair, with character designs that stylish and unique, set pieces that are nice to look at, and shading that sets the tone for each panel. However, when in motion the results are iffy, some of the fights just really don't look very good and are hard to keep up with. The blur style they use doesn't really portray the motion the characters are taking and often just looks disjointed and bizzare, like each movement is breaking both time and space for the sake of plot. Granted, this is generally only an issue in the early part of the series, and is far less noticeable later on. Character 8: the characters as mentioned before are generally well developed and mostly turn into interesting figures within the narrative, with one exception. The bully is just the bully, he has no other characteristics and has no redemptive qualities. This is a bit of a shame, but is understandable given the clear zero tolerance message being expressed here. Still I feel it is a bit of missed opportunity to make a deeper message on the circular nature of abuse and bullying and it could have really elevated the story to a higher level. Enjoyment 8: this series has three key details that make it stand out and keep it entertaining: a surprisingly unique and well developed lore, a solid character line up that works well together, and a strong moral message that doesn't sugar coat important and serious concerns. The manwha may not be a masterpiece, but it is a damn good read that holds well to scrutiny. Overall 8: If you are looking for a solid martial arts tale, featuring an underdog rising story that expresses strong moral arguments in a very relatable way while not holding back in explaining the serious nature of bullying and child violence, then you will enjoy this series."}, {"score": "8", "content": "the breaker wasa the first manhwa i read, and boy was it a enjoyable ride. the series starts with this emo character who is always getting bullied, who is even thinking of suicide. but his life is about to change by meeting a martial arts master who comes to his school to teach. but this master has a secret to hide Story - 8/10 the story starts slow and to many it might feel a bit predictable, but by the mid you get hooked by the actions and the amazing world that gets revealed to us. and finally an unique ending which leaves questions in your mind......(kinda forcing you ... to read the sequel) Art - 10/10 such crisp art man you will love it! I dont generally give much emphasis to art in rating but this series defiantly gets good score for good art. the artist knows how to make the panels look good.

The perfectly encapsulated, most excellently written underdog story I've ever read. But, it begins as cliché'd as humanly possible. Bullied kid trope, reaching the height of a world he's unfamiliar with. They've got incredible, hidden talent, built from their mental circumstances, and an iron, unbreakable will. Sounds awfully similar to “Hajime no Ippo”, “The Climber”, “Holyland”, but the difference is an unparalleled sense of pacing. A kid without a footing, Shioon, tries to attain peace in his school life, while being able to protect those ... he loves. His problems spill over to his best friend, and so, the new, weird, and violent teacher, seems to be a window of opportunity. Shioon blackmails him into training him, and as the teacher tries to get rid of him, he finds this strange sense of familiarity. Both share more in common against all odds, but there's something deeper than Shioon is ready for. The story is all about movement, about the next scene, about the point of the story. If a moment doesn't add to the characters, to the point of the story, they clearly didn't put it in. Even if a scene feels like filler, it's just there to add tension. I can't overstate how intensely fast everything here is. Not every story puts a time limit on every action the characters make. Every second is filled with trouble that stems from past actions, a legacy of pain, and suffering, that a good-hearted kid suddenly changed. Fight scenes that rival the best of the best. Characters that change, that evolve, or others that simply reinforce what they believe in. I HATE stories that stay on the same track the whole time. The decisions made by the characters should impact the world around them, and here, the characters are entirely aware that good times can never last in these circumstances. The strangest group bonds against this martial arts world, and you can feel the emotion they share, how much it changes them, and how they want to perpetuate it, only to be met with reality. Choices instantly change the narrative, choices that seem stupid at the beginning, but make sense even if they're annoying for some parts of the audience. A wild ride, accompanied by some of the most beautiful art out there. The fights have this… impact. This sense of brutality with paneling, with how they position the characters right at the edge of frame to convey how powerful an attack was. The character expressions, the use of visual callbacks, and the way the world is built, the visuals that show true, unparalleled will against all odds. You just feel it, it's art that makes you feel something, and I still get chills thinking about the quotes, about those moments that make this series what it is. Dialogue is perfect, characters are perfect, story is small, concise, to the point. Characters have the right amount of scenes to love them. I have to say, this is a masterpiece, without a shadow of a doubt. The next installment is a little more flawed, but I'll review after my next re-read. 10/10. I hate the audience and their slander towards the protagonist. He's the perfect character for this story, and I'll DIE on the hill."}, {"score": "10", "content": "The Breaker is a must-read; simple as that. If you haven't read it yet don't waste any time and go right ahead, but if you have some reservations, continue reading. It's important to mention that I've read the series several times already, my most recent read-through just a week ago as I wanted to see how it holds up compared to newer series. And how does it hold up you might ask? Quite well in fact and is more than deserving of its top 10 Manhwa rank on the site despite being more than a decade old. While the story concept is nothing new, the universe that ... the Breaker takes place in is compelling and greatly distinguishable from others. There is so much intrigue going on in the background that you can't help but want to find out more. Due to this overarching plot, a strong foundation has been laid out in order for the sequel (The Breaker: New Waves) to really shine. The same can be said for the main character Shi-woon. While some might understandably find him the spitting image of the standard mold of a weak character who becomes strong, there are glimpses of character growth that we see and yearn to explore. At times, it is frustrating that Shi-woon teeters between strong and weak, but it's important to remember that he is just introduced into a new world with immense power, and getting adjusted to that naturally takes time. The art at times is reminiscent of old school manga, the panel choices and sudden change in style during comedic scenes a breath of fresh air ironically enough without it looking overly outdated. But when it comes to the action? There are few with the same creative vision that the artist of this series has. I still find myself amazed by the unparalleled martial arts fight scenes displayed which is one of the reasons that the Breaker should be read just for that reason alone. I was nervous going into my most recent read-through that I wouldn't experience the same enjoyment that I had compared to when I first read the series all those years ago. I couldn't have been more wrong and am glad that I was."}, {"score": "7", "content": "This deserves a higher rating. Lavish praise will take up most of the review. However, I am simply unable to rate it higher. If this manhwa caught your eye via its cover (as was in my case), you won't be let down. The art is stellar. If you have a habit of saving good-looking panels on your phone, expect your storage to take a hit as Park Jin-Hwan is not pulling punches. Clean, concise, yet knows to be gritty; fights have a dark tone to them that lets you feel the stakes. It sells the rigidness and harshness of this world really well. Speaking of the ... world: Through Shi-Woon the reader slowly descends into the world of Murim. I'll tell you right now: he will never see the bottom of it. It is a world of rich tradition and culture. Names, terms, and techniques will quickly pile up and you will most likely lose track. Yet, I'd say it benefited my experience. It adds to the idea of this world being vast and explorable. Even if you ignore them, you will be able to follow the story. But eventually you will start memorizing all those names, and it feels rewarding. It connects you to the protagonist as he is also a commoner thrown into Murim and knows to feel lost. You are a novice, as is Shi-Woon. The one thing this world has more of than tradition are beasts. As it is naive to believe you came to the bottom of Murim, it is also naive to think you are some hotshot in Murim. No matter how great you may be, never will it be a challenge to find someone greater. Numerous characters will make an appearance over just a few panels, yet they will terrify you. Even if a rookie lands a blow on a master, no matter how great he may be, bones will get crushed. When you are hit, you are HIT, and that hit WILL have its consequences. Strength is not defined only in power backing up the fist, but also in movement, evasion, respective techniques, resolve and willpower... Shi-Woon, thou not to be underestimated, will always feel beatable, even laughably weak compared to many others. Everything said above tells you that if one is regarded as \"a master\" here, he is truly worth being afraid of. It isn't all fighting, however. Sometimes it's a death match; other times it's a dumb comedy/romance; it even knows to be a serious drama. Characters are over the top. Allies and enemies sprout out of nowhere in some of the most bizarre ways (a fucking janitor rides to school in a Lamborghini, that's the level of shit we are talking about). In times of peace hell can break loose with a snap of a finger. The entire journey feels like a mad fun movie you'd go watch with friends on a Friday night. I've read this manhwa in little more than two days. Once you get hooked, it's over. \"But it's generic\", to which I agree. Shi-Woon is an average commoner, thus he will be a victim of \"generic\" things. And some of those \"generic\" things have some truth in them. Being bullied can take vicious forms, many of those forms feeling, and sometimes even being, inescapable. A human can be pushed to the limit where there is nothing holding him onto living. However, revenge will only add to the problem. There are grim moments in the story. And I agree, there knows to be Deus Ex Machina in play, problems won't always be resolved by Shi-Woon's will and action (cliché of the protagonist being thrown into a new world where he isn't only welcomed but is also very talented, maybe even a prodigy, in contrast to reality where he is plain and insignificant) ... I am not defending it, I am saying it isn't something that can't be seen in other works as well, and that it knows to be done shallower than this. In an odd way, that \"generic\" nature adds to his character when compared to others toughened up by the mercilessness of Murim. You will see him softening up those around him exactly because he does not give value to ways others see as tradition. Among an already solid main and side cast, Shi-Woon ends up earning his rightful spot. It is a simple and fun manhwa with its fair share of hard hitters. Despite its flaws and often-times poor humour, it's bingeable and entertaining throughout the whole read. Where does the problem lie then? The problem lies in that this manhwa was planned to be a trilogy. The Breaker is followed by The Breaker: New Waves and The Breaker: Eternal Force (still being written at the time of this review). This leaves many themes, connections, and conflicts unresolved, alongside one part of the ending feeling underwhelming, and the other losing its value. After finishing The Breaker, you are incentivised to read New Waves. New Waves, however, (in my humble opinion) is awful. Not only is it painfully average, but it also ruins the appreciation for the first part. It ruins it because New Waves has so many problems, bad enough that you can't look back on the first part without noticing those same errors in it. You won't be seeing them at first because part one is brimming with action and novelty, next to it being 10 volumes long; on the other hand, New Waves is 20 volumes long, thus those flaws have MUCH more time to reveal themselves and bother you. The third act is expected to be 40 volumes, and I personally have a hard time envisioning how will it evade those very same problems. This leaves a reader in a conundrum: you can opt out when finishing the first part, leaving a fair share of the work unresolved / unrewarding; or you can continue to New Waves, and waste your time on an average 20 volume manhwa which kills your sympathy for the first part. It is underwhelming in both ways. I really enjoy the breaker as a whole (even the second part has some charms, simply I don't think it is worth it), yet I can't help but think the writer accidentally caught lightning in the bottle while writing the first act. No matter what the ultimate decision may be, I recommend reading the first part, then deciding for yourself. I still think it is a very entertaining story with memorable scenes. To say that I enjoyed it is an understatement. Personally, I am sad it couldn't have gotten a rightful successor... Thank you for reading this far. I wish you all the very best. Kind regards."}, {"score": "5", "content": "I don't know what's the hype about this manhwa. It is pretty average. The art is decent but it doesn't justify the high rating it got. Maybe it's not my cup of tea although I do like martial arts and over powered people. It starts out interesting but then it becomes kind of stale. I read only 8 volumes and felt no need to get the last two. Honestly, I don't even feel much happened in those 8 volumes. Overall I'd say it's not good or bad.

But I enjoy how consistent they were with the jargon (even if they changed the translations back and forth throughout) and the dialogue was pretty interesting. The art was amazing, it changed drastically throughout the series and in my opinion only got better. Despite the characters looking somewhat bug like they were very attractive and the panelling was easy to take in, on top of it the action scenes were incredibly easy to follow and they even had some special 2 page ... panels that depict giant fight scenes. Characters were kind of a hit and miss for me, the selling point of the protagonist was that he is incredibly naive and pure but it went a little too far trying to prove that point sometimes which sort of ruined immersion for me. The protagonists 'crush' was also unrealistically trusting in him which was also a turn off. Other than those two traits of those two characters, all the characters were likeable. I even liked the bullies because of how they were written, though I did want to punch them quite hard. All the time I have spent reading this manhwa was worth it and I have read it over again 2 or 3 times now. I do wish Shi-yoon developed actual martial arts abilities that weren't reliant on the strength of his ki, but that was a minor displeasure."}, {"score": "8", "content": "There's no need me writing this as is evident to the continuous list of reviews with rated 10 but with free time comes great.. no, not great but a responsibility to write a review from a not so imaginative, opinionated person who dreams to be a writer. The Breaker is a series that broke from the overrated fighting solo hero, school life routine that is rampant on many comic I've observed. I've read the first 3 chapters or so and I knew I would waste my time for a couple of hours to finish the volumes available, in which, with luck was already completed. You know ... the story. A teen in school. Weak and socially awkward, bullied. And here, with a drum beat, the master, feared and infamous to many great artist, not the one with paint brushes. The kid asks the teacher, literally as this master was a teacher at the time, to teach him kick ass. Typical story? Not. Read the other articles here. They have said it eloquently. But since this is a review and I have to detail the awesomeness, and justify my 8 rating, here goes... boom, wa paahhh. then girls go ahhhhh.. ohh he's so awesome! then hero goes as long as good exists, evil never prevails... I will save you ... ugh. noooo. I will never give up yo! (scratch the yo)... And that is why it's a manga worth watching (I mean reading, man. sheesh, really).

Story 8/10 The story is great. There's no other word to define that. It deals with a bullied boy, who after seeing his new english teacher beating up a couple of gangsters, decided to make him his new martial arts master, no matter if the teacher doesnt want to. He will get rapidly involved with the \"Murim\", the martial arts world, that's not so kind, specially with Chun-Woo, the teacher, who's actually the \"Nine arts dragon\", one of the stronger, if not the strongest of them ... all. The premise is really simple, but it's told in such an effective way, and becomes so much complicated... Despite all, the story is certainly the weakest part of this manwha. Do not misunderstand, it really is great, but from the beginning to the very end, it seems like a great prologue for the next part: The Breaker New Waves, although I havent read it yet. The way the manwha proceeds, the way it ends, all seems to let you think that that's not the end, that's only the beginning, and what will happen next is actually the main plot. And at the end of the manwha, I wasnt fully satisfied.. Art 10/10 Never seen such beautiful pages, such amazing splash arts... The artist is a prodigy. The fighting scenes were so good, I wanted more and more of them, they did never bore me. This is absolutely the strongest point of the manwha. Characters 9/10 Uhm... I don't really know how to say that, but this is the first manga in which I couldn't find a single annoying character. They were all fun, even if they were depressed (like the main protagonist in the first 10/20 chapters), or weak (like Soseol), they all managed to amaze me and, like the drawings, they did never bore me. Enjoyment 9/10 As I said, the fighting scenes were next level, but that's not the only reason why I gave 9 out of 10 to \"Enjoyment\". This manga was actually quite funny. The jokes or funny moments were never put in wrong places, they were actually fun and managed to break the monotony of that scene or that situation. A character also broke the fourth wall! \"Hey calm down! We're here at the ocean and should be having fun. And the authors even made the effort to use color pages for fan service...\" \"Dammit. What's with the sudden ocean thing? I understand we've been starving for color pages, but...\" Overall 9/10 I really, really, really wanted to give this manwha 10/10, but the constant prologue feeling didn't let me do so. This had the potential to become the greatest manga/manwha I've ever read, but it didnt manage to do so.

I was trying to hard not to spoil anything i ended up writing nothing so here's my second attempt First off one thing i loved about this is that he doesn't need to relearn to fight he knows how to fight however he can't because of his ki center being broken. I'm sure as soon as he gets his ki center fixed he'll be back to his old self Story - The story revolves around the kid this time around ... instead of his master. It starts off exactly at the ending of the breaker with the Sunwoo. Where he is asked to be the Sunwoo Leader because of the Talisman he received from before, while adamant in his decision not to involve himself with Murims he is warned that he is still infamous and targeted by those who seek revenge for what his master has done even though he was deemed normal from the Association. The Association has their hands full with Goomoonryong so they are unable to help. Goomoonryong has also attracting many followers who are causing more problems by rampaging the streets brawling with normal people and committing heinous crimes. after the first few chapters it picks up much quicker than the prequel perhaps a bit less comedy though it is still there with a touch more romance. With so few chapters out it is hard to give it an accurate score at this moment however i feel this story has more potential than the prequel (this was when i was at chapter 31) now i can safely say this is probably one of the best things i'm currently reading and look forward for every new chapter that comes out Art - Loved the artwork it is so detailed, you are never left thinking... Huh? what happened while starring at the artwork trying to decipher it. it is just as good if not better than original. Characters - while you may miss some of the old characters like i do it introduces new likeable characters quiet well. Certain things that happen in main story trigger memories for the new characters and i found this to be very nice while not interrupting the pacing of the main story it gives more info on the new characters. Enjoyment - After i got past the rocky few chapters that felt a bit surreal i absolutely loved it I cannot wait for the next few chapters was left at a cliffhanger... woe is me"}, {"score": "10", "content": "~This series just keeps on getting better and better from the very first chapter. Now, this MANHWA (korean manga) is at a point that it is on my fav. list. Before, I start reviewing I need to say 2 things. 1. This is a sequel so make sure to read \"The Breaker\" its prequel before reading this. 2. I will try to be less plot revealing and make it more temptating, so you guys can read it. Plot 10/10- If you thought the prequel was good then the sequel is just even more awesome. I mean just name even 10 stories where sequels were good as or ... even better than the prequels! Surely, The Breaker:New Waves is in that list. It picks right after where the prequel ends. All that bully that Shi-Woon faced in the prequel is back because his ki-center is destroyed his enemies no longer fears him even though his Ki-center is shattered he still remembers all the basics and fight his way through from the brink of death that's the best thing about our main lead Shi-woon he never gives up. I think I have said enough about the plot and Trust me, The best part is yet to come, He goes master level later for that you have to read this gem. This series have that unbreakable pace that makes you want more chapters every week, Since this is a manhwa creators tend to take 2-3 months break to gather enough source material and this sequel is on my on-going list from last 3 years. Art- The art is just so beautiful, It feels like you are watching an animation (though I would love to see an anime version of this). The epic and detailed fight scenes in the series is something that gives this series high re-read value. Characters- Needless to say anything, If you have read the prequel All characters are back with some new characters that fits perfectly right into the story as for our main character Shi-Woon goes through all different kind of hardcore situations that gives him badass personality development in this sequel. Enjoyment- If you have read my review till now, It may sound exaggerating, but it clearly fits the hype!"}, {"score": "6", "content": "The Breaker will be considered the prequel and New Waves the sequel. Martial arts has always been intriguing and looking at stories where characters who are weak, wanting to get stronger is a journey of self discovery. In some ways, media that projects this topic is relateable to viewers because most of us want to follow our bliss and find a path that truly fits us. For The Breaker, Shi-Woon is the young boy we follow to search for his path of self discovery. This review reflects the series as a whole rather than just this sequel. I'll do my best without spoilers for the prequel ... or this, but the story seems to follow a linear path for the predecessor, where as prequel opens the world up to other factions within the Martial Arts community(Murim). The Breaker does a great job fleshing out it's story with giving us the perspective of other factions, but the same cannot be said about New Waves. The premise is run of the mill and seen elsewhere, but the series has an edge with the awesomeness of Chun Woo. The dude is a beast and is the most feared existence within the story and his effect on the plot and characters are executed well. While it is a broken record by the end of the series, his existence brings meaning to each character. At the end though, the series leaves a lot to be desired mainly because of inconclusive ending and some plot holes(eggs). Characters are a mixed bag, most development comes from Chun Woo and Shi Woon. Nothing is wrong with that though since they are probably the only interesting characters within the series and the oldhead in New Waves. The first season handles Chun Woo and Shi Woon with care and we see both of them blossom, whether it is a good or bad thing. However, I did feel like the flash back memories that we see are out of place and always come up in convenient times. Not only for these two, but for other characters as well. It is not the best way to go about justifying the character's actions and beliefs and seems a bit forced. Also, New Waves becomes awfully stagnant in character development. There is a limit to how naive some can be and to push that limit creates a repetitive vibe. The side characters are very forgettable, I mean all they do is contribute to the plot. It's what their there for but at least give them some characterization instead of sexualizing the females and showing us how emo some of the male characters are. Some female characters I have in mind are definitely useless to the series as a whole. A LOT of plot convenience and flash backs drive some of these characters and I wasn't fond of that while reading The Breaker and New Waves. Art is pretty cool, really brings out the characters emotions and action scenes are well defined. Picturing the scene in my mind with the SFX already seems really intense. Wasn't expecting in this series, but fan service was existent and probably was the only form of comedic relief which was eh. Overall, The Breaker has more ups than downs. Obviously all reviews are subjective and people are titled to their own beliefs and enjoyment, but the inconsistent flow of The Breaker can turn off people. It is an enjoyable, action shounen read. Looking for a good cast of characters, you may or may not find it with this one but there are certainly some interesting characters in this series. The story was OKAY; it deviated from what I thought was gonna be and went into bumblefuck direction honestly. Give it a read if you like a protagonist in search of self-discovery."}, {"score": "7", "content": "So I was surprised when I went to my manga reading site to find that this manga, sequel to one of the my favorite manga's ever, had a 'Completed' tag. As a loyal fan that read the weekly release I feel a sense of duty to review the sequel, having already done the first entry. (*DISCLAIMER*I HIGHLY recommend that you read the prequel 'The Breaker' to have all the necessary knowledge going into this one.) The short version: (+)The majority of the characters are well done. (+)Story leads in well with the prequel. (+)Fight scenes are the best of they're kind. (+)Arts gives great emotion weights when it's needed. (-)The MC ... doesn't change. At all. (-)The story does drag in parts. (-)Those without prior knowledge of the series will have many questions. THE GOOD: Being a 200 and bit chapter manga about martial arts, you are going to need many good things to present to the reader to keep the coming back every week for your story. That said, there are two things that The Breaker: New Waves has in spades, a good art style and good action segments. One of the things that this manga never failed on for me was to show the reader just how emotional these characters were in the situation they were in, when they're joking around with each other outside of the actual fighting, you can tell. When someone important to the characters in question has been killed in front of their eyes, you see that impactful shock, and when the sadness hits soon after the amount of tears and snot running down their face Just shows you how much they cared for that person, but the moment that I enjoy the most when it comes to the art is when you see someone, normally the MC, get really angry, you get that same feeling from the picture that you would if you happened to piss off someone like Gilgamesh or Guts for example, and the Black Origin Threshold is still as terrifying as when I first saw it. The action is one of the key stones in any fighting, second only to the story, because the story lends tension to the actual fight scenes so you're even more invested in it, failing that the fights still need to be good, even if they only serve as spectacle. I'm glad to say that the fights in this manga are similar to a firework show, they're built over a couple of chapters and then when the moment finally comes you are gifted with a very satisfying, and occasionally frightening BOOM. Some of the fights do go for more chapter that other's, but fights in martial arts manga are like games, you spend a lot of time on the smaller fights to make sure you're ready for hen the boss finally comes around to destroy you, they pace the fights in a similar manner. The story continues more or less straight from where The Breaker left off, with only a couple months worth of time skipped and for the ones that jumped straight in after reading the prequel, you settle back into the whole world and feeling that the first entry gave you within a couple pages, this is why myself and everyone else recommends reading the prequel because if you start with this one you're going to have plenty of question that won't be answered anytime soon like, \"What's a ki center? Who the nine arts dragon? the fucks a Murim? What's the S.U.C?\" But when you've properly enter the Breaker world, you will feel right at home with everything going on. THE BAD: Now let me get off that the characters, for the most part, are not bad, there's just some that kneel-cap the rest of the group. The MC for example, after having his ki center smashed, and after all the shit he has seen, is still persisting with his \"I shall save everyone and make everyone love each-other.\" view on the martial arts world, granted is working so far, but after close to 300 chapters of following this guy around across two mangas, his outlook hasn't once changed. In my mind he has become a static character, like in a lot of shounens, his opinion never, ever changes, no matter how much he sees, or how much he losses he sticks to that belief. I know it's for the whole purpose of showing the other characters how determined he is, but we've already seen that, it was called The Breaker, just be a bit more dynamic dude please. Also he apparently has some sort of shield protecting his romantic virginity because, like with the prequel, he doesn't become romantically involved with any of the chicks, granted there is one that he will PROBABLY get with, but until I see that I'm sticking to my guns. Another thing with the characters is that, from memory, some of them straight drop off the map, they don't appear later in the manga, they just *poof* into smoke, like one of the MC's old bullies joins up with the 'bad' guys and they fight once then *poof* that character disappears. Other guy that had a SWEET pair of gauntlets had about three or so scuffles with the MC then I never saw him again for the remaining 60 chapters. The story also tended to drag a bit, but I thinks that's more to do with the fact I had to wait a week for the next 20 pages of story to happen, but read one after the other with no interruptions, it only got the point where I thought, \"Come on let's make something happen.\" Then lo and behold the next page made something happen. Still I felt the story did slow down in places. THE VERDICT: The Breaker: New Waves is a solid sequel to it's predecessor and I look forward to the third entry. While I started to loose faith in the MC as a character and a few characters turned into magicians on me, the rest of the cast, fight scenes, story and art all scored high enough in my charts to keep me coming back for more every week. After reading The Breaker I highly recommend that you move straight on to this one. Go. Fly, FLY MY PRETTIES!! Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next one."}, {"score": "8", "content": "(Edited as of 8/23/2013) Okay decided to edit my whole review after updating myself with it (haven't read it for more than a year) I did say New Waves kinda disappointed me abit compared to the first one. I really really love The Breaker so I was expecting something really good with this one. At first I think the story kinda drifted off from what I was expecting but after reading it up to the latest chapter, I can say that \"Finally! This is getting good.\" Thrilling factor is still there of course. Art is very good. For me I think it improved alot. In the The Breaker, ... the art at first was really \"manly\" though in the last few volumes, the art \"softened\" a bit. But here I think the artstyle totally \"softened\". Well it's good for the eyes so nothing wrong with that. Character are.. well there are lots of new characters here (mostly females) and in my first review I don't know why I said I kinda don't like them.. but now I can say I really like them. Came to like Shioon more. But lack of Goomoonryong. And not to mention that it's like he turned into the main vilain here or something. But we will see. Overall it was still a good read! But still slow pace of story. I'm not really sure why I said in my previous review that the fanservices bothered me so much but now.. well it's okay. Anyway! If you're an avid fan of The Breaker, then don't miss this! It will get better in the later chapters!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "I'll keep this short and simple. The premise of the story is amusing, very unique and enjoyable. It surpassed my expectations, at first it was really annoying how Shi-Woon (MC) was defenseless, naive and weak; I thought it would be Tokyo Ghoul-esque battles all over again. However, Geuk-jin brings back focus on Shi-Woon again with him being somewhat competent in the series. The art was satisfactory for the most part. While detailed and attractive to the eye, the only problem is that it's monochromatic. I haven't read much manhwa, but the ones I've been exposed to have been poly-chromatic. Doesn't hurt the manhwa itself but the ... artistic potential was deterred, I feel. Jin-Hwan, great job. The characters themselves are fine, and that's what saved the manhwa for the most part. Except the character development was kind of poor, it always appeared to me that Shi-Woon had extreme bipolar tendencies, not sure what to make of that if it was intentionally written in the script by Geuk-jin. It introduced many countless new characters that are mediocre, most of them stayed the same through out the manhwa. I won't forgive the lack of Goomoonryong in the first part of the manhwa though. What the actual fuck? Geuk-jin seemingly deleted the single most interesting character in the series for around 120 chapters in favour of \"character development\" by the end of the manhwa, which if I may reiterate, is virtually non-existent. It stretches to the bipolar MC that gets his ass smashed every other chapter of the first half and it's agonizing. The lack of a sequel is self-evident of the mistakes of the authors. While flawed, I thoroughly enjoyed this during my teenage years, so the sentiment is high. But none have been portrayed in this review, I hope."}, {"score": "9", "content": "The Breaker NW is a Korean manga or manhwa and if you're unlucky like me and read the mal description before finishing the original then you're probably really curious about this one. well NW isn't over yet at the time of writing but it looks like its heading towards a conclusion and thought id just write some stuff i had to say about it, (ill probably update this once the series is over) so lets jump right in: Story: when i had only started reading NW i had somewhat mixed feelings about it, the original ended very well in my opinion but at the same time it ... sort of set things up oddly for its successor(if you've finished the original, or once again, unlucky like me and read the description you probably know what I'm talking about), and that's not really a bad thing, it helps gives a sense that NW has its on structure as a complete series rather than being built entirely around the original and just being a continuation of it. and while that's all good it does give the series a sense of slow progression, don't get me wrong there's always action and the plot constantly moves forward its just that the plot device that was set up by the original makes it feel slow, but maybe that's just me. other than that though the story is great, the series does a great job(NW and its predecessor) of creating a world and you really feel like the murim are on one hand people but on the other hand this different race who have their own rules and code and are an entire society built in parallel with regular society with constant struggles and conflicts to maintain what is clearly a fine and delicate balance between the two. there are also plenty of clans and styles of martial arts that help expand the murim world even more and keep you at the edge of your sit wondering what the next move will be. i will say this though, and you cant take this as a good or bad thing but NW seems to often depend on not \"suspension of disbelief\" but rather \"suspension of belief\" in which no matter how many times a character does something insane of extraordinary the others just cant seem to accept it and are shocked anew each time, I personally liked this, the series knew how to make it work and did a good job setting the intervals between each time this happened.(oh and p.s the main character went through so much shit that he has transcended just zombie or badass) characters: OK this is one aspect in which i had to debate with myself a bit, again, when i had only started reading NW i had mixed feelings, one of the reasons for this is the new characters introduced, most of the main cast has been replaced and i didn't know how to feel about the new characters, with some feeling like they were recycled or copies of characters from the original and some just feeling like the show had gotten a little bit lost in fan service, don't get me wrong I'm not opposed to strong female characters but i don't think that the panty shots were necessary, but luckily for me NW eventually set me at ease and the characters grew on me after developing beyond their first impressions and i while never felt there was much back story in the series that didn't stop me from liking them, on the contrary, that means i liked the characters based solely on their actions and personality during the present events(which is harder to pull of than it sounds and there are show that just try to give the characters a tragic past rather than making him interesting during the events). art: OK this one should be a no-brainer, NW continues the original manhwa's tradition of having amazing art that's very detailed, but most importantly turns the fight scenes from something in between the plot into the main course and does a great job of setting the tone of the situation and expressing the characters emotions. I really have nothing more to say about it, its absolutely spectacular and i think you need to see it to believe. so final thoughts: in case you haven't noticed i went through 189 chapters of NW in just 3-4 days and why is that? because 'The Breaker: New Waves' is awesome, its thrilling, its exciting and you don't really need all these details when it can be summed up in one sentence: the more i read, the more i want. and so with that i can honestly say there isn't a person i wouldn't recommend this series to(the same applies to the original, obviously) and regardless of how it concludes it is definitely worth reading."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Updated ( 10/6/2013) A lot has changed since my previous review of New Waves. Let's get started. Story 8/10 The story of New Waves is that Shioon, after the events of The Breaker, has to cope with life without martial arts. However he is still be targeted for being NAD's ( Nine Arts Dragon) disciple. During one of these encounters Shioon meets the fiery red head Jenee, who is ordered to protect him by the people of the Sunwoo clan. Later it is revealed that the Sunwoo clan wants Shioon to be their new leader, and thus begins the story of New Waves. The overarcing plot of New Waves ... if that of Shioon trying to cope with being in a world of martial arts, without the ability to do martial arts anymore. For those that have read The Breaker ( all of you reading this review I hope ), this seems like things have gone full circle, to how things were in the beginning of the The Breaker. This can make the plot seem like it is moving slowly, and that \"nothing\" has happened over the course of 10 chapters, but let me tell you, the slow build up has MAJOR pay offs ( especially around chapter 50+ ). Overall I would say, while the story is very \" basic\" it does well with building up, and keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen in the next chapter. Characters 7/10 While the plot may have its moments, outside of a few characters, the cast of New Waves, is very sterotypical, with many characters not given time to flesh out their personalities, or not having very redeeming personalities to begin with. Most of the villains are just \" I want to take over xxxx, I am right you are wrong \" sort of thing, while there are a few exceptions to this rule, for the most part it holds true. The main characters all develop nicely, and get plenty of time to build up their characters, making the main cast very likeable, and makes you really get into events that revolve around them. Overall I would say the characters, while generic, are redeemed by the main cast of characters being unique and their character development. Art 10/10 One of the best drawn action series ever. The fights are easy to follow, the characters look amazing, and the backgrounds are really well done. The art conveys moments of action so well it makes your blood pump, moments of sadness so well it makes you cry, and moments of the funny so well it makes you laugh, just off the art alone. Enjoyment 9/10 While I will admit the start of New Waves is very slow, and it takes a while for the payoff to come, the series, once it picks up, makes you not want to put it down. Be it from simple fights, to clan wars , the series has it all, and never makes you want to put it down. I am currently up to chapter 131. Overall 9/10 I would recommend New Waves to anyone who wants a well drawn out action series, with a great main group of characters, and edge of your seat action making you wish the next release would hurry up."}, {"score": "9", "content": "First you must read THE BREAKER as this contains a lot of information that will help you understand the problems Shioon is facing. I accidentally read this one first and had to go back because A) slightly confused on what was happening & B) THE BREAKER was a great read and gave me new insight and info on the sequel. The story is fine but all it really is about is Shioon having to relearn to use his powers though it has taken an interesting turn as he may have found a way to fix his broken core. Kinda takes a History's Strongest Disciple ... approach as he has to train and work hard to regain skills although it is in my opinion much more serious. The artwork always stuns me. Honestly i love the artwork and wouldn't change it. It got a 9 b/c i haven't seen anything anyone said is a 10 before so i would know if it was higher. Really takes you into the Manhwa and the scenes are great. The characters are actually a bit worse then THE BREAKER. it's bad to compare them, but i think since it more focused on Shioon you don't get to see as much into the others although i think Jin-le Kwon is a great addition in this one. Unfortunately you don't see to far into the characters past ( Jin-le Kwon and Jae-kyu Kwon, grandpa are the exception as you'll see a major development from past experiences.) Shioon is a great focus be he somehow seems to have only one gear. Once he goes to do something nobody can stop him and makes him seem almost invincible at points and while i like it it seems like he will never lose. OMG i loved this. You can really read this over and over in fact just writing this is making me want to reread it. You can't get tired of it b/c it really doesn't ever go into repeating patterns as the author has thrown in twists and different obstacles. Not saying you wont see him doing the same kick-ass moves it's just you cant get vored of them cause you see them so rarely. Highly highly recommend you red if you want some action a lil bit of romance and love martial arts related stuff. Find yourself a nice cozy spot to read and sit back, relax, and enjoy."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Hello this is my first review so please give me pointers because this review will probably be trash. Story 10/10 Where do I begin nothing I say can do this masterpiece justice. This manga or manhwa is the pinnacle of story telling I don't want to spoil anything but let me tell you this much this story is a thrill ride from start to finish and I just could not get enough of it. Art 10/10 The art in this manhwa was stunning. It is the first time that from just looking at the art I could tell how the characters felt without looking at their facial expressions. ... The way the art flowed made it feel like I was watching an anime rather than reading a manhwa. It was beautiful and stunning but also chilling and shocking at the same time. Never before have I loved looking at the art of a manhwa or manga as much as i did with this one. Character 9/10 The characters in this manhwa were for the most part perfect but some of the supporting characters could use a bit more explanation. Enjoyment 10/10 I enjoyed reading this more than anything else that I have ever read and that includes many every book I have ever read. This manhwa was enjoyable on all levels and when I had finished it I felt like I was missing a part of my life. Overall 10/10 This manhwa was perfection in all senses of the word. It is a must read for any fan of manga. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to do."}, {"score": "3", "content": "I really wanted to like this one... The Breaker: New Waves is the sequel to The Breaker launched in 2010, the same year the latter ended. I'll be blunt: it under-delivers. It's bad. There isn't much I feel for it next to apathy. Majority of its ups stem from my appreciation for the first breaker; the very same appreciation I got robbed of when finishing New Waves. It does deserve a few compliments. Thou slow, the beginning and its premise are good. Once you step into Murim you are part of Murim, simple as that. It's also a throwback to one seemingly insignificant, but in hindsight very ... consequential moment in the first part, which is great. Next to that we have the entire cast of the first, alongside many new faces. The art is still really good. There are some interesting arcs and hard-hitting moments... That's probably as far as my praise goes. First off, why are we introducing so many new characters? You have already formed this huge repertoire by the end of the first part which it could barely handle. New Waves is twice as long as the first; shouldn't we focus on fleshing out the already existing ones? The answer is: no. In fact, it's worse: all of the already established cast you've grown accustomed to will get side-lined in favour of the new one. Of course, the new cast is not horrible; there is Ji-Nie, Elder Kwon, Ji-Gun, Sera, Cool guy, Ghost Hands Divine Healer... So, the manhwa focuses on them? It does... As long as they are in the spotlight. Things happen only around Shi-Woon; the moment they move away from him (which they inevitably will) they turn into immobile chess pieces so that others can get into rotation. Having so many characters alongside this abysmal treatment of their makes the pacing devolve into some weird flavour-of-the-month structure which makes me numb to any enjoyment I could foster. But let's forgive that too. So, you put them to the side? Fine. That leaves most of the resources dedicated to the cast under the spotlight. I have to ask then: why aren't they doing anything? The villains stand there as bedrock waiting to be penetrated, continuously reminding you why they are standing there in the first place. Allies are no better: they appear when necessary and obey what they have been told. Although, they do one thing consistently: talk. Oh, and do they talk a lot. It makes reading New Waves a chore. By the end, barely will any character get enough time, let alone will that time be used well. Oh, and every relevant female character will devolve into the \"I secretly find the protagonist cute\" type who's only job is to commentate on the situation and praise the protagonist's \"might and resolve\", while being castrated of any characteristics that made them interesting, let alone value to the overarching story (by the end it feels like the only purpose they serve is to be on the cover). Of course, Shi-Woon doesn't feel anything towards them; he doesn't even notice it, so we can't even call those characters love-interests. Which brings us to Shi-Woon. Shi-Woon is as bland as it gets. He doesn't change. You may argue he does, but you know you'd be lying. He only gets accustomed to the circumstances and pushes on in his ways; his beliefs and philosophy stay the same. He always fights for the same reasons, he does everything he generally does, his aims and motivations are never challenged... He is constantly rewarded for being himself and nothing pushes him in any new direction. In the review of the first Breaker, I listed it as his charm, so where is the issue? The issue is that there is nothing to be put against him as contrast in this supposedly vicious world, that now all of a sudden seems to value this vanilla good boy. It genuinely grinds my nerves. That is not restricted only to his character. In the first part he is a talented novice with a few good moves but is ultimately reckless and will get beaten by anyone capable of dodging or countering. By the end of New Waves, he... He is the same, but now he is winning. He learns a whole of two new moves which, although cool, are barely used. Rest of his development is the work of lazy Deus Ex Machina. His fighting style is bound to mindless fist-flailing until he magically sees an opening and lands a blow. Even thou there are multiple \"breakthroughs\" in his training, there is legitimately no change. Some of the weakest character progression I've ever been a witness to, if I can even call it a progression. Power scaling in this world is already very loose and context based, so you can imagine how having someone like Shi-Woon always winning completely annihilates any concept of strength hierarchy. I have no idea if there is any plausible explanation for him not ending up in a body bag when he, with a broken ki centre, decides to take on those stronger than he ever was in his prime. That happens multiple times, by the way. There are no stakes and risks. Consequences don't matter, being in actual danger is a myth. Some characters get the short end of the stick, but even then, it's because they wanted to sacrifice themselves. The entire motive of Shi-Woon persisting through his sheer will and lack of any fear to hold him back now feels like some of the shittiest protagonist privilege one could come across. The entire story is simply a mess. There is no sense of direction. The twists are cheap. Bizarre moments which gave the first Breaker charm now don't land. Characters are done both dirty and poorly. And, of course, all of the previously mentioned has copious amounts of empty talk to go along with. It's a bad movie that tries to pull the audience's attention with basic shock value. However, my main gripe with New Waves is its length. This is a 20-volume read. That's 200 chapters. Now, I agree; manga knows to be numerous times longer. But there are so many works you could have read instead of this which are not only shorter but offer more entertainment and sentimental value than this. Length should be justified, and New Waves does not have any reason to be this long considering its contents. And here I am, having written over 1000 words of critique concerning this title. Do you think I am glad about that? Know I am not. I will always enjoy a good read, and I wanted to like this work as much as the first, if not more. I remember how eager I was to hop onto reading it. There are foundations of something that could be great, there are occasional strong moments, there are lovable characters, there is potential... And yet I can't help but view this read as a waste of time. As I've noted in the previous review, the first Breaker has the same issues as the second, but the second has way more time for those issues to grow noxious and without that novelty and dynamic of the first to prevent it. I can't even look back on the original without seeing those glaring flaws. Who knows, maybe you will enjoy New Waves. I know I didn't. I doubt I will read The Breaker: Eternal Force, which at the time of writing this review is very much young. Maybe in the future if I ever stumble upon it being finished. Even then, I will think heavily whether I am willing to put up with estimated 400 chapters of mediocrity when these 200 have already proven difficult. Thank you for reading up to this point. I wish you all the very best. Kind regards."}, {"score": "10", "content": "(Read The Breaker before moving on to this) - 129 Chapters as of writing. *TL;DR versions underneath the long ones :P After I finished The Breaker in about a week and loving it I moved onto New Waves with a hopeful expectation it would live up to the original story. For me, it's done more than that. Story - 10 The story carries on directly from The Breaker, with Shi-Woon losing his Ki Centre (allowing him to control the flow of his Ki, allowing him to use Murim-esque abilities). After Goomoonryong's departure Shioon is trying to adjust to a normal life once more, although due ... to him being the infamous disciple of Goomoonryong he is targeted by vengeful Murim members and as the holder of the Phoenix Medallion (Given by Sosul) Shioon still holds major ties to the Sun-Woo clan, meaning avoidance becomes increasingly impossible. Aside from Murim-in's there is now a new major group - Soldiers Under Command, its members follow Goomoonryong as he if were god and are intent on starting a new world by his command, the information revealed about this organisation is really scarce which really increases the anticipation for even slight revelations. TL;DR- It picks up where it left off. Shioon is trying to live a normal life once more but he can't as Murim-in's target him and the Sunwoo clan respect him due to Sosul giving him the Phoenix Medallion. Also a new group called Soldiers on Command - Stating they follow Goomoonryong appear and become the main antagonistic group (so far) in this manwha. Art - 10 I really, really love The Breakers artwork. In other manga/manhwa sometimes I have trouble seeing what's happening in fight scenes, or getting confused on which supporting character is which (E.g. Witch Hunter). But I've never had any problems when reading this, the fight scenes are clear on whats happening and the characters all have really unique looks which helps express their personalities too! TL;DR: Really good, characters easily defined by their unique aesthetics and great design. Character - 10 I think this is where New Waves excels over The Breaker. Any thoughts of the negative effects of Goomoonryong or Shi-Ho were quickly dispelled for me. And minor characters/organisations (E.g. Sun-Woo, S.U.C) now take a much larger role, with many, mainly younger (hence the title New Wave) characters being introduced as main characters. Interaction feels much more informal with Shioon too as they are younger, rather than older characters who usually treat Shioon like a child which is pretty refereshing. The doubt over whether or not Goomoonryong is a antagonist really builds the anticipation for when (I'm assuming) Shioon finally meets him once more. As the new characters aren't Goomoonryong it gives a better sense of the power ranking too (Goomoonryong just destroys everyone pretty much in The Breaker). TL;DR- Loss of Goomoonryong and Shi-Ho aren't too big due to the amount of new characters who appear in New Waves. As they are mostly younger it gives more time to show a more natural side of Shioon rather than the formal rapport between him and Goomoonryong. Conclusion - This Manhwa is fantastic, even better than the original. If you've read the first and enjoyed it then you truly need to add this to your collection too, this was more than a cut above everything else I've read so far. 10/10 TL;DR - Read this."}, {"score": "7", "content": "I just going to put it out there... New Waves is not as good as it should be No, I was not held back by my expectations, i read eagarly through 150 chapters in a sitting, but i felt that Shi-Woon was just a punching bag for about 100 of those chapters... In terms of his progression as a character, he hasn't gone far. He is still the strong willed fighter, nevering giving up. However, when he becomes teh elader of teh Sunwoo clan he seems to have attained leadership qualities. BUt to me it just seems like cockiness. Also his \"brave\" \"leadership\" traits are wasted when he ... interacts with Chun Woo, he doesnt fight him and acts like an invalid. As you may also have noticed Shi is continuously underplayed, giving teh notion that he is \"weak\" that he has a reason to be in the current state of patheticness (chp. 150). But we must remmeber that Shi is special in that he took a dan pill got invigorated with Ki, then became the student of the most badass martial artist, also somehow wins over the phoenix pendent which allows him to become the leader of the Sunwoo clan. Yet he's still so pathetic, his martial arts have made little progress and his character is still weak when faced with a real challenge (when he can fight Chun). In every single fight the opponenet of Shi lets him off beacuse they belive that he has speical \"recovering powers\" or \"they want to see him reach full potential\". Really as a martial artist and character overall he hasn't changed much. I think they have used his life too cheaply in that Shi is always putting his life on the line announcing how he is willing to die all the time. I believe as a martial artist you should not always have the mind set to be willing to die, it does not make you strong. The romance between Jin-le was really nice early on however i think that the introduction of Sera was a bit much. In The Breaker, the edgyness was taken off with the chibi illistrations of Chun. This was really nice, since i cant stand watching a Shi covered in blood for 50 chapters. The chibi style drawings have dissapeared in New waves, which means that the authors want to maybe make the story more serious. This is oh-kay, but since this manga originated with a mixed style they should've kept it since it was a good aspect. Another thing that bothers me is that since this is a martial arts manhwa, i think there needs to be more realic progression in combat. As in, iron fist style, there are more eloquent and useful techniques than just \"ran at opponenet and grab concrete\". Sigh. I know Chun is like the 9 something dragon, most OP martial artist. However if he can \"take over Seuol\" then shouldn't there be other people like him around the wrold. I mean, come on, there isn't just like 9 schools of martial arts... I mean theres boxing, muay thai, sambo and others more. Also later one i feel asthough the manhwa is trying to take the storyline and action to an international level, this is wh i feel that teh diversity in combat is lacking, it's aiming to get bigger but with so little a base for construction. The fact that other asian country's have a strong standing in martial art's, then why hasnt the manga introduced them? I mean if a guy can come into a country run around killing hundreds of people and still be able to escape wouldnt it make international news? wouldn't other martial artist around the world come to kill him? or challenge him? (CHun) Overall i think this manhwa is an 7.5-8/10"}, {"score": "5", "content": "Story 5: Breaker: New Waves' biggest downfall is in this regard, where the prequel, The Breaker featured a unique and strong narrative format this one...doesn't. It kind of meanders about, without much direction until a sudden, almost out of no where plot development appears progressing the narrative for all of half a chapter before meandering again. Whats bizarre is how little the story actually develops over a long period, its to the point where a large portion feels like filler, which really hurts the series as a whole. Art 8: The strongest point of the manwha, the art is absolutely on point. Where its predecessor had ... issues with portraying motion and action in its fights scenes this one has no such problems. It also features more unique designs, stronger shading, and a lot of variety in body types and postures among the cast which are utilized to the fullest in the fights, giving great visual presentation. Character 6: The characters for the most part aren't too bad, with a couple being surprisingly solid with variety of character's that shift sides dynamically with their motivations giving them a nice sense of growth as the series continues onward. the main protagonist on the other hand is really poorly written over all and pretty much acts as a blank slate for the reader to impose on. In the predecessor, he was relatable because his views reflected the trauma that he endured and in turned helped him grow to be a well rounded figure. However, in this one he's got as much depth as wet cardboard with the word \"chivalry lives\" written on it. He doesn't change and doesn't grow and god he is just beyond my comprehension. Enjoyment 7: This was a fun experience when viewed as an individual story and not as a successor to the previous series, The Breaker. It has excellent art, strong character variety, and still has solid lore detail that is intriguing, but the themes, character depth, and stakes are just not present. Over all it makes this feel a bit too shallow to be as satisfying as the original. It has needless filler, and a lot of plot threads just don't go anywhere or serve any real purpose to the story as a whole. Overall 5: If you want a fun martial arts action romp than I highly suggest this series. The art and over all design of the series creates an atmosphere that is both enjoyable and intense. However, if you want an emotional under dog tale with a lot of depth then you'd probably best avoid this one, which is a shame given how much better the original was."}, {"score": "10", "content": "The Masterpiece is back... The Breaker: New Waves is a sequel to the manhwa \"The Breaker\", and is in my opinion even better than its father manhwa. A good warning to everyone, there might be some spoilers in this review, so if you haven't read The Breaker, i recommend that you stop reading this review right now, you have been warned. The Breaker: New Waves keeps following our old main character, Yi Shi-Woon now with his Ki-center broken by is own master, in what seems to be Yi Shi-Woon back to his every day ordinary life... But ofcourse having the great Nine Arts Dragon, the strongest and most ... godly person in the murim world, as your master has its own sets of drawbacks ... The story picks up after the events at the roof and Yi Shi-Woon recovery, and Yi Shi-Woon thinks is life as a member the murim world his over, but he is being targetted by a new threat, he is also (unknowingly) the gajuu of the Sun-woo clan since he got the medallion from So-Sul during her rescue missing, proving he is the leader of the Clan, and so we keep the story Yi Shi-Woon in the murim alive. Not wanting to spoil the story, i'll stop here, but trust me when i tell you it gets SO GOOD. The art, like its predecessor, is still amasing, the level of detail in the background and the characters just make you think the drawer is someone very near the level of god in his respective field of art, and sometimes you get treated with really beautiful and realistic drawings of close ups from characters that just make your eyes cry from hapiness. We are also introduced to some new characters, like the super smart super beautiful super cunning Kang Sera, the current head of the Mil-Yang Clan, and Kwon Jin-le a member of the Sun-woo clan and granddaughter of one of its elders, entrusted with its new gajuu protection. Great character development for this characters, Yi Shi-Woon and some others who i wont spoil will ensue, with the return of some other memorable names from the past like Han Chun Woo also known as the Nine Arts Dragon overall make for a entissing and great story. As you can see from most of this review, i complety love reading and following this manhwa, its currently my favorite work (and i doubt very much that that will change anytime in the future), so it goes without saying that i recommend this work of art to anyone and everyone who read the prequel, and if you're reading this and haven't, go check it out before you read this one or you might not understand everything. Overall, the breaker: new waves is a gift from god to us humans so that we can rejoice in happiness from great story telling and unbeliable art work, i hope you enjoy it as much as i did."}, {"score": "9", "content": "The manga as a whole is very interesting. With some interesting twists but to understand the situation of the main character you have to read the The Breaker. Read the first manga to get a feel of the situation that Shi-Woon is facing. At first it starts off with the main character as helpless as ever having lost his fighting ability. So he decides to live a normal life. But problems arise and he dragged back into the world he was thrown out of. Having to fix himself to enter back in the world. He sets out to make himself stronger. In a different status ... then in first manga. Now is a leader or Gaju of a clan. He learns new things and gains more strength and eventually learns about his master. Now going on about the plot the plot was interesting as it involved trying build the main character back to his original strength. There were new enemies introduced. Now matter how much he tries to escape that world it comes right at him. I gave the plot or story a 8 the art a 8 as well since I felt that the characters well well drawn out and it was better looking that most Manhwa's I've seen. The characters had interesting back stories and development so i gave a them a 7. I enjoyed reading the manga and seeing as the story progressed but i also enjoyed the fighting scenes. 60% of why I enjoyed this manga was because of story and 40% was because of the fighting scenes in the panels. It is very well drawn and it a very exciting martial arts manga. Overall I gave this manga 9.

Other than that, the action and fighting scenes are great, and the relations between the organizations envolved in the plot are really convincing. Therefore, if you didnt read \"The Breaker\" I would not recommend this manga at ... all, but if you did, you already have a opinion about this sequel. If you got here wondering if you should read this or not, then read \"The Breaker\", cuz its fucking awesome."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I know the plot from this one better than the back of my hand. Five times. I've been stuck here, waiting, expecting for the new part to arrive someday. How does it fair after the last read I'll give it? Masterpiece. No other words, or adjectives, to describe it. As the second part of the series, it chronicles a new beginning for every character. If the beginning was an intense ride or die situation, this one feels much more like the consequences. It couldn't be the same, not after our main character became the most infamous human being to grace this particular action world. So much ... effort, sacrifices, and tears were shed just to keep the status back to square one, and none of it mattered. Placing Shioon in an even worse situation than ever before, it feels like an urgent need to reach for the stars. The first part identified itself more as a roller coaster. The actions taken had a natural, inevitable quality to them. Every moral compass clashed, and created this narrative for itself. However, “New Waves” is more of a self-imposed, multiple choice narrative. It's the moment it could've changed for good, one way or the other. The main character takes us to his story, not his teacher's. He messes up, comes up with solutions by himself, takes extreme risks to advance the plot, while still being the metaphorical Mcgufffin of the world. It's INCREDIBLE. The story sends us in a path of no return for the forced maturity of Shioon. I wouldn't call it a coming of age story, or a one of adulthood for that matter. That happened in the previous one, and surprisingly, it takes more on the themes of love, family love. Love for those who motivate you, for those who took a risk for you. In a world filled with hatred, fights, or the constant of death at every confrontation, a wholesome guy destroys the conceptions of hatred by doing all he knows… his best. It's so powerful to see a monstrous, old, and routhless leader, corrupted by politics, revenge, and family quarrels, crumble in front of a kid who protects those he cares about with the utmost honesty. Again, he's the only, and most perfect protagonist for this story. His actions speak louder than his words, his loses scream as much as his victories, and his wins feel so rewarding because of his progress in a hostile world he doesn't originally belong to. It's all about his decisions, and how he uses everything around him to make everything a better place for those he cares about. Love, without being corny, without needless drama, but with actions that ripple throughout this world. Characters are another piece of the perfect puzzle. So many of them, new, involved. The old ones develop even more, serving as human beings, rather than obstacles to overcome. The past is much more important in this series, since this isn't a beautiful, cute world. Tragedy will always follow those who're old. Tragedy is always at the doorstep of the young. Everybody suffers so much, in such an organic way, but again, Shioon steals the spotlight for unyielding will. Imagine, in a world of talent, prestige, sacred bloodlines, hierarchy. The rules are brutal, but this one, a kid, who searches for the best of those around him, changes EVERYTHING. I said it before, but I'll say it again. He's the domino piece that changes this world, and those he affects become such a big part of the story that you can't imagine the amount of connection you'll feel by the end. I call this a perfect narrative, and an improvement in what I already described as a perfect story. Every action matters, there's not a single chapter, or page you can skip. Effective in storytelling, perfect in execution, with some of the best character writing in the medium, and the art is something that's only getting better. It stopped using those beautiful perspective-bending panels, which is a small shame, but the fights retain that brutality we love. The art takes a much more emotional approach, rather than a subjective view of what's happening. Scale increases, we get more environmental damage in every picture. Not the same, but just as great for what it achieves. 10/10. There's no doubt in my mind. This belongs in the golden road of martial arts media. Perfect in every way, even if the authors constantly doubt their craft (they comment a lot about messing up in omakes, humble mfs)."}, {"score": "8", "content": "So, the Breaker Part 2. I binged the first one and this one in a week. That alone should tell you it is good. But it annoyed me a lot as well. Let's get into things: Story (8): The story is well written, suspenseful, intense, dramatic, and overall well done. But it only gets a 8, because I didn't enjoy the story it told. To elaborate, Breaker 1 was fun action and drama, and really intense. But New Waves forgot to include one of those: the fun. The main character grows as a character, beats villains, and occasionally you get a good rush of fun from a ... villain getting punched... but it almost completely lacks the comedy and all the light hearted elements that made the first one so great. Instead, it wears down on you with constant tragedy, cliffhangers, and dark tones. I entered it expecting to have a fun time... but by the end, while I still wanted more, I left more tense than I entered the story. Their is no resolution, just constant buildup. Overall, the story was 10/10 for writing, 10/10 for immersion, 10/10 for making me want to continue... but a mere 6/10 for actual enjoyment. Art (10): Art is great, and unlike many action mangas, it manages to convey the motion fairly well, and you can picture how the scenes would look as an anime. Very good, perfect score from me. Characters (8): The characters are more complex than in the Breaker 1, but they lose some interest when all humor is stripped from them. Everything is serious and dark, and that leads to a drop in how much I like the characters. It's hard to like people who have no fun in their lives. Enjoyment (6): Pretty much as I said in Story. I didn't enjoy this, really. I put a 6, because it kept me reading, and I didn't leave it hating the author. But man, it is dreary.

Daytime Star didn’t contain any unnecessary drama, and instead focused on the evolution of the main characters’ relationship.

The hardships both the ML and FL faced were realistic, and were all resolved throughout the manhwa, fitting its perfect length and ensuring it doesn't feel rushed. Its very nice to be able to see a ML who is a green flag occasionally, as lately most MLs are toxic and very pushy towards the relationship. ... Kang respected Yura without forcing himself on her, something which happens in many famous manhwas and passes by unnoticed or marked as “hot”.

As a romance, this manhwa was meh. The story and characters for that matter, couldn't be more typical- but I do appreciate how the FL can stand up for herself every now and then. It's such a shame we couldn't get more of that because we need the ML to save her at every panel. I would've easily rated this story a four because while I enjoy it, I already have had enough K-dramas where the rich and much ... more accomplished ML helps out the hopeful and sincere but gets the short end of the stick FL (bonus: it is never really explained why such an \"extraordinary\" ML fell in love with an average FL). What made this story fun for me though is how funny it was, at the most unexpected moments no less. I feel like the author wasn't really taking the story seriously when they were writing it and I like that, I like how they revert to caricatured chibis for dramatic effect. I especially like the deadpan ML chibi, I think it's what made the typical jealous scenes that I normally wouldn't find funny hilarious. I like how the characters' deliver the most unhinged lines from time to time too and then get embarrassed after. The cherry on top for me, a close second to the ML's chibi, is the actions the FL takes- which was honestly so embarrassing at times that it made me drop my phone and scream to my pillow to end my misery. What can I say? It's the comedic element of this story that really made me stick around through the end. Of course, the more it neared the end- the less we got of it, but for what it's worth- I haven't read a romance with hints of comedy for so long and I am a sucker for rom-coms. While this didn't rom-COM the way I wanted it to, it rom-COMed enough for me to not feel like I've wasted my time bingeing 77 chapters. I also appreciate that the author didn't stretch out the serious moments for too long. Nonetheless, I don't think I've laughed so hard at a manhwa the way I did with this recently. Maybe my humor is shallow or my life is at extremely rock bottom that this is the thing that makes me laugh now, but I believe laughter is a difficult reaction to garner and if the story was able to do that for me on more than two occasions, then it's not a completely bad story."}, {"score": "4", "content": "This is a self-insert comic.

The story is about the protagonist’s actress career, but that’s secondary. The most important is that there are hunks, and that they are giving her attention. The plot is dime a dozen, the characters have no depth, it’s the usual “all important people are beautiful” writing, simply a land of fantasy that tries to pass of as real life. There's nothing about the characters that makes you say \"wow, interesting, I ... wonder what will happen to them in the story, now I'm invested\". Of course, nothing except \"I do want to see more fanservice of those pretty people, damn\".

Our main character is fortunately much closer to a human being in both behaviour and abilities than the others present in a action fantasy setting. The struggle in the growth of the mc is visible though the actual difficulty of ... struggle is not properly conveyed because obviously one cannot show his every attempt he takes to complete an event. The story has plot holes but most of them can be swept under the rug by making the use of the fantasy tag and the remaining are the ones which I expect to get patched up in the future as the chapter increases. The mc also has a decent enough backstory assigned to him to make him a good character. The art in this one is a strong point as it utilises cinematic scenes and (if I be honest) an overuse of extreme closeup shots, which actually serves a purpose to make the expressions of the characters more focused on. The characters if have to be honest about don't impress me that much.

I consider time loops to be a relatively easy premise to make fun but an incredibly hard premise to make amazing — most stories take the “fun” route rather than the more emotional, conveying “harder” side. And although this story did take the “fun” route, it’s still god damn peak. I was a bit worried with this story’s treatment of each “life” at the beginning due to how many the mc just threw away to make small progress. But god damn; although the story doesn’t make each life meaningful, it makes the journey incredibly entertaining. In short, the mc is an absolute psychopath who ... continuously wants to die to get stronger, which is already an exhilarating concept to think about. The mc is one of those stoic/cool types, but he has somehow yet to cross the threshold of edgy. There’s not a great way to describe him, but his entire personality was crafted well enough to carry the story. As for the side characters, they are all memorable and unique in their own right. However, they are more on the lines of suitable to keep the story moving/engaging. I wouldn’t cry if they died, but I would certainly miss them. As for the storyline, it’s pretty basic—the mc continues to die and gets stronger until he achieves his goal of becoming a knight. And although it sounds pretty simple, the author did a great job of making each challenge fresh while adjusting the mc’s progression accordingly. This manhwa is just an adrenaline overdose, and honestly, I don’t tend to enjoy stories such as these. I prefer my light-hearted romcoms, so even if I, a certified romcom lover, can enjoy a mostly pure action story like this, you know it’s gold.

The first thing you notice while reading this manhwa is that the art is truly stunning, so you wont have any kind of problem when it comes to the visual aspect. It is set in a fantasy world inspired by medieval times as many other manhwas, so maybe it isnt that original, but the premise of the story makes up to that. We follow our main character which finds himself trapped in a time loop so that every time he dies he ends up resetting his day - just like re:zero if you may. The thing is that this is made in a ... really entertaining way so i can assure you that it won't feel tiring whatsoever. The characters are good as well, at least I find them entertaining as well. It could be true that anyone besides the MC is there only for the sake of the MC, so that he becomes more powerful with every reset. However, I don't find this bothering at all as if not like this I don't know how they would make the MC progress without giving him some cheats (or another fucking game system).

For some reason, manwha authors tend to make their main characters incredibly unlikable, but that isn't the case in this story. He is a good guy who tries his best with what he is given. I don't understand why more authors don't use this style of character development, as most of the ... time the characters are unstoppable by chapter 20, meanwhile this MC gets bodied left and right, even in the current chapters.

Like I can't help but cheer for him cause I forgot sure would have given up but ... Encrid even argues with the guide to death (the boatsman) to keep on getting stronger.

I've read this story over 4-5 times now, and yet, each time, I fall deeper in love with the story.

Shim Cheong didn't actually grip me from the start; the setting, language and promise of yuri is what kept me reading. I wasn't expecting even for a second that the story would turn into a mix of mystery, suspense and fantasy ... on old Korea, and one of the best things I ever read. Shim Cheong blends the innocence and simpleness of Asiatic sequential art with dark, serious themes delivered by a writing of the highest level coming from its writer, Seri. Heavy on details of the era it describes; Shim Cheong plays with music, literature, fairy tales and visual arts to tell its tale, and elevates itself to the same heights of the tales it sings about. Its deep cultural connection with its setting makes it obvious how connected with it its own writer is, making it not only a fun, but also intellectual read. Biwan, on the other side, does her work as a manhwa artist in a capable, if not unimpressive manner for the most of the time. It is, though, on the brief of a few important scenes that her work shines in poetry, colors and stunning details, showing her stellar skill as a conscious artist working under the constrictions of time to make a much polished work. If the writing could do well on its own, Biwan shows with her depictions of the beautiful meeting the ominous that she's a fundamental part of the title, and it wouldn't be the same without her. Despite their bibliography, the due proves to be extremely experienced and versed on the art of manhwa writing. Shim Cheong knows exactly its place and gives every single step with intention, thriving not only as a manhwa, but also as a proper story in every single one of its elements. No matter what you're looking for in it, be it a romance (lesbian or not), a mystery, a suspense, or an old Korea tale with hints of fantasy; this should be your pick."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Two different women, same wish, a wish to die. One is a rich but sheltered girl. Life's necessities are always within her reach, but not the means to escape the household which suffocates and harasses her. She always needs to worry about how she appears to others or else she won't survive. The other one, due to some circumstances, leads a beggar life. Unlike the first woman, however, she doesn't need to worry about how others perceive her but she does need to worry about what food she will eat tomorrow. Due to an incident, their lives become intertwined. How will these two women affect ... each other's lives? (this paragraph might contain light spoilers) Her Tale of Shim Chong is a story about two women discovering fun things in life through their interactions. Fun things that they never knew exist. In a world that favors men, they fight and struggle to live another day. With each of their meetings, they formed an irreplaceable bond, a bond that could even be beyond friendship. Don't let the Shoujo Ai tag fool you though, as this story has some pretty sad topics. The unfair treatment of women under a patriarchal world, the sweet temptation of death in a life full of suffering, the frightening lack of difference between a sheltered life and a beggar life for women in a world that favors men are a few which are tackled here. Just to be clear though, this is not that depressing but it still is a pretty sad story. Hopefully that sounded interesting. But really, I was just expecting a cute shoujo ai manhwa before reading this so it's a really pleasant surprise to find a manhwa with a story as great as this. I'm just going to say this just in case but if you're expecting a yuri manhwa with many NGGHHHH yuri moments, I suggest you read something else. While this indeed have some NGGHHHH yuri moments, it's more focused on how these two main characters change each other's lives with each of their meetings. I'm not going to say this manhwa is for everyone. But if you're a bit open to stories that are a bit sad and a bit yuri like this one, then I highly suggest you read it. Even if you're not a yuri fan, I believe giving this one a try is very worth it since I personally believe this is a hidden gem. There aren't too many yuri scenes (though there are definitely a few MHHMMMM yuri scenes), and if you're looking for a great story, then I believe this manhwa is for you. TL;DR Great read. Highly recommended. This isn't filled with yuri scenes so non-yuri fans could still enjoy this, though yuri fans would definitely enjoy this more. The story is also very meaningful and you could pick up one or two lessons from it. Great story and great characters. A somewhat tragic tale, but not too depressing.

What I actually found was an immensely thoughtful tale of women - not just the two protagonists - women doing their best to survive in a world that has knives pointing at them, ready to wound at the slightest opening. Though that's already enough of a hook, what really pulled me in was the careful treatment of class dynamics in the world. The difference in station between our sacrificial bride and the titular beggar-girl is like ... night and day. Their struggles are completely different. Chong is right to call bullshit on equating the struggles of having to fight for your next meal and in-law political intrigue, but she throws herself into it alongside her new 'friend' nonetheless, in what starts out as a sugar mommy kind of situation and deepens into something so much more. It's very easy for a topic like this to devolve into almost pornographic misery, with nothing but examples on examples of the ways women are subjugated and have their wings clipped not only during life but even after death (ancestral cemetery scene was a real wow), but this book keeps a hopeful undertone in the middle of, or despite, it all. We start out already knowing how this is going to end, right from chapter one, but the journey there has given so much food for thought to me. As this series was only brought to my attention with the announcement of a second season/volume, I write this having finished the first season, and regardless of how things are going to go, I give this a 5 star rating, simply for the way the telling has been going, the thoughtful dialogue, the palpable class violence, the way it even helped me understand more of myself while keeping me rooting for our two protagonists the whole time.

It might be a dusty, cobweb-laced book, but it's my book, and I absolutely loved this yuri. Every other yuri I've read doesn't even come close to the number of chapters I've consumed for \"Shim Chong\"; I was hooked to this manhwa from beginning to end, and I even read all the epilogue chapters. I ... adored the relationship between Shim Chong and Madam Jang; it was great to see tangible changes in their attitudes and behaviour due to rubbing off on each other. It was great to see how the playing fields shifted as Shim Chong and Madam Jang changed, revealing more about the cultural surroundings and stacking more cards against the couple. Their love begins and ends like poetry, and not just for-a-literature-grade poetry; this shit was like it was from Shakespeare, Vince Gilligan, and Eminem. I genuinely can't describe how much I loved this manhwa; I am not doing it justice with this slipshod review. If I could pick at the most minute of nits, I do wish the art style and quality looked more like the volume covers. But I really couldn't give less of a shit about the art, because the narrative was just so damn good. I never expected this yuri (or any of the yuri for that matter) to use such good set-up-and-pay-off; every call-back had me perking up and leaning towards my screen. This yuri had exemplary pacing; the narrative was always moving forward at a consistent rate, with solid build-ups and substance being shown off with each passing chapter. And dear Heavenly Father, the monk was just despicable and great to read. He perfectly gave off the vibe of someone who thinks their shit smells like roses, and wholeheartedly believes that their vile behaviour is justified. But I think it'd be a disservice to just cite the monk as a great antagonist, when it truly feels like almost every other character was an antagonist. This manhwa perfectly conveyed how restricted women were in this culture, and not just by men too. It truly felt like Shim Chong and Madam Jang especially were trapped by tradition and even their own families, making their minuscule reprieves from society's standards feel like freedom from jail. I don't think my words can properly articulate how I felt about this yuri or its quality, so I'll leave you with a recommendation, or a few.

They were more friends then lovers, and they didn’t even have good chemistry. Sure the story was interesting, but did I enjoy myself? No. Don’t read this it’s not worth it."}]}

This btw, is one of THE BEST manwhas out there, for me tho, dunno about you guys. But I got hooked on this since the first chapter and didn't want to stop reading this for days, weeks or even months whenever I have the time to. This has become bread and butter in my daily life. That is how Intrigued I was with this, in short I got addicted since the day I laid eyes on it. Well ... enough chitchat shall we? Time for the review I guess? Story 10/10: the story is about a tower built by someone (A god maybe? XD). No, it is actually about a boy who was left all alone at the bottom of a tower (more like a basement) since he was a baby, until he was found by a girl. Then they grew up together on the outer areas of that tower and one day this girl decides to go up the tower, for some unknown reasons, her dream maybe? (nah..she just want to see some sparkly things up there duhh). The boy then ran after her for he doesn't want to be separated with her (talk about clinginess to the max). Then they found themselves at the door and accidentally the one who was sucked in or rather chosen was none other than our protagonist BAM! (leaving the girl behind???? XD hey no spoilers you mofo!). And that was it. A new adventure awaits BAM. As he was searching for the girl (he loves?) new mysteries unfold about his past, his fam, his powa! While learing about the purpose of the floors and the tower itself, about why hasn't anyone reached the top yet, And why do they have loooooong lives? About the harem king which is on top, jk, He will each solve these mysteries as he meets his new badass friends along the way (and possibly a waifu! Make that two, no it is a HAREM!) And so the story goes on and on. Yeah. So the story is magnificent. The pace is not too fast not too slow either, good balance between suspense and drama, I don't mind it being to long since I'm enjoying every part of it. Well that for me tho. Art 10/10: It is simple and at the same time it's beautiful. Simplicity is beauty.. you can easily distinguish scenes on every panel. Characters designs too are badass. Watch out for BAM his transformation is the best! Characters 10/10: hohoho man, the best there is, the development is quite good. As you go in deeper you'll find out even more cool ass characters and even bad ones. Enjoyment 10/10: well I haven't caught up and waiting if I didn't enjoy. Overall 10/10: you guys should probably read this. It's a must!"}, {"score": "4", "content": "Never before I had to force myself to continue reading a comic so much like I had with Tower of God. Having to load another of the endless chapters pained me greatly and often I found myself distracted by literally anything else rather than to continue reading. This means that it took me great amount of time to arrive at this chapter count and my strength and will weaken with each another chapter. I'll try to continue, but I don't know for how much longer I continue this thorny journey. Sure, there are a lot of worse manga, but at least those tend to be entertaining, ... if only because of how bad they are. But not Tower of God. ToG is just blunt boredom. Weaponized boredness. The work where you'll be wishing to do anything else than reading it. Now, lot of fans keep saying that it does get better and that I should keep on going. I recognize this pattern, I've already seen it with Homestuck and Salad Fingers communities. And like them, I hope Tower of God will be left in the dust of history someday and my life will be peaceful again. Real talk though, does it actually get better? Well... yes. Technically. But mainly because the first part is so horrendous, that even the mediocre continuation is an improvement. Although, the main improvement is art. Let me describe the art of the earlier chapters a bit more. It looks like 2009 deviantart creation made entirely in MS Paint. The character design is like that of a fanfiction OC originating from the forementioned site. Worst are the drawings outside of action scenes, where the characters are frequently off-model and just unpleasant to the eyes. But yeah, the art gets noticeably better. We're talking about almost 100 chapters of bad illustrations though. The plot is, as you might have guessed, a big mess. Most of the time nothing interesting happens, and the rare moments that might distantly resemble entertainment are gone quickly. The pacing is horrible and it takes forever for the plot to move somewhere, especially with the trials that tend to get too complicated and drags on forever. The plot doesn't seem to be much well thought and it's more likely that it's made up on the go. I get the feel that the author just thinks of some elements that sound cool and throws them into the next week's chapter without much thought. The plot goes both everywhere and nowhere. There is both too much stuff happening and nothing happening at the same time. I have no idea how the author managed to attain this zen state of storytelling, but I can tell you that it's nothing enjoyable. The most glaring problem are the characters. The cast is bland, shallow, one-dimensional and instead of actually developing at least some characters, the author just throws in bunch of more new characters to get your attention. There is barely any chance to get attached to any of the characters and the comic doesn't really try to get you do so beyond the tactics akin to \"look what cool power this character has\". This results in fights that should in theory have some stakes but that fall flat because you just don't care what happens to the characters at all. As the cast is treated as props, not as real people, all of this feels just artificial and distant. The worst case is the main character. He's pretty much a blank state that miraculously keeps getting more powerful pretty much by being at the right place in the right time, not to mentioned being marked as \"predestined\" to be powerful right from the start. Blank, because we know near to nothing about this character. For most of Season 1 of the comic, all we know about him is his name and that he came from outside of the tower. And even the little background info we get later is ultimately nothing. Now, I'm not against the idea of protagonist with mysterious background, but this is just taken too much to the extreme. Not to mention that Bam's only personality seems to be \"I have to protect my friends with my power\". That's it. The core characteristic of generic battle shounen with nothing on the side. Of course, this makes the protagonist perfect for self-insert. Huge power, \"cool\" aura and no starting personality. Just insert the reader. In fact, the protagonist is so uninteresting that the best part that I've read so far was the part where he was gone. For a brief time the webcomic switches to a secondary protagonist that comes from more ordinary background and follows this character and the group around him for a while. This is also the closest the characters get to... actually having a character. Of course, that is ruined when the focus shifts back to the main protagonist and the dullness takes the lead again. At this point, even if rest of the chapters were magically somehow really good, it still doesn't change that over two hundred chapters were dreadfully awful, and that alone is enough for ToG to lose the right to be labeled as \"good\". Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless your preferable medium of choice is soulless product that you can keep mindlessly consuming. I fail to see why anyone would continue reading this except for the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The story sure keeps raising a lot of questions, but I prefer reading something where reading the story itself is enjoyable, not just the \"waiting for the answers\" part."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I wrote a full review on reddit if you guys want to check it out. Art: The art is very unique and drawn by the author (SIU) himself at the start. Art is not its strong point at the start but bear with it as he gets way better as the story progressed (ongoing for almost 10 years now) and now he probably has an amazing team helping him out. Check out some new chapters if you're curious about the difference in the art now and then. The characters, shinsoo(kidna like energy in this story) , background scenes, fighting scenes, killer moves and techniques are ... all drawn to the highest level of detail and beauty nowadays. Story: Not gonna go into the details to avoid spoilers but it's simply outstanding. Other reviews might have an outline of the story if you're interested. The pacing is slow at first and it might be confusing or boring depending on your taste, but absolutely stick with it. I'll just say that it just keeps getting better. Take your time, be patient and enjoy yourselves. There will be a moment when you start to go crazy and get obsessed with this story. Character: The main character is the overpowered type. The destined one with unlimited talent and background. He's not the best character in the story and kinda typical for a shounen MC. . The other characters are where it's at. So many characters who are all written to absolute perfection. Their relationships, family background, character designs (they look cool, their names sound cool, they act cool, etc...). Even minor characters usually show up or are involved in something later on. Everything and everyone seems to connect really well with everything else. Overall, Tower of God/10. Definitely one of my favourites of all time and probably the best ongoing manga along with AOT"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Synopsis: I can't really say anything without spoiling much. Essentially, the protagonist follows his friend up a tower (or in this story, THE tower), at first trying to find them, while also getting caught up in the tower's circumstances. Side Note: This series is quite lengthy with 452 chapters as I write this review. Story (10/10): At first, the story doesn't seem so complex, but as you continue reading, you discover more and more about the workings of the tower. What I would compare this to is Once Piece, where the reader is introduced to more and more of the world's secrets as ... you progress (though One Piece does this a bit better). In doing so, a large portion of the earlier chapters may seem bland, but in actuality they are used as set-ups for later chapters. One other thing to note: this webtoon/manhwa has a habit of setting up competitions through sometimes overly complicated rulesets. I think this is a good idea, but sometimes the author goes overboard. Thankfully, the author has begun to do less of this in recent arcs (however this is just my opinion). Art (9/10): Going to be honest, the art in the earlier chapters is pretty bad, around 4/10. Thankfully, with so many chapters, the author has greatly improved (or maybe he hired artists, idk), so that's why I have it a 9/10. The art is unique and has its own style, and the colorization is a plus for me. Character (7.5/10): Once again, this manhwa has a huge cast, just like one piece. Unlike One Piece, it fails to really bring depths to its characters. Each member of its large cast does have distinct personalities, but often the huge cast pulls away from individual characters. Also, some character motivations, are, well, questionable. Overall (9/10): Overall, the strengths of this manhwa outshine its faults by a significant margine. Unfortunately, the earlier chapters of it give a false representation on what the series is entirely about, so you might need to sit through some average chapters to get to the real meat of the manhwa. I also don't recommend this as someone's first manhwa (only because it has a very unique style), but I would recommend to anyone who has read a few (4 ish) and are looking for more."}, {"score": "5", "content": "ToG was one of the first manhwa that I ever read around 5 or 6 years ago, and I do remember enjoying it but still dropped it somewhere along the line. I recently decided to reread it again after seeing overwhelmingly positive reviews for it (8.74/10 makes that pretty obvious), however, I found it awfully mediocre (especially the 2nd and even more, the 3rd season). Story: 6/10. The first season was decent. But the second season and third season just seemed like a remodelled first season. I stopped there, but I assumed the 4th season would be the same. This is a problem with the very ... concept of 'tower-climbing'. This story can very easily become an endless repetition of having to overcome obstacles after clearing levels. That's why character development is so important (I'll get to that later). What could have added depth to the story is the whole Rachel conflict motive, however, this also falls super short. We are barely given insight into Rachel's motives, her thoughts etc. She has absolutely no significant meaningful development. And because of this, the whole story just collapses in on itself. Not to mention the whole load of inconsistencies. Art: 7/10. The art does improve and it is pretty good and has some detail. However, since it is a fantasy, with a pretty interesting and (at the time, 2010) unique tower concept, I thought the art could deliver more in terms of world building. The backgrounds tend to get very boring and repetitive, and fail to create a real sense of immersion with the world, and since I find the action and character part of ToG pretty bland, I was hoping for some redemption here, but alas. Also, the character/costume design is utterly bland. Characters: 3/10. This is my main problem with ToG. The characters are so boring, and undergo no meaningful development over the 417 chapters that I have read. There has been some development, yes, some development hinted at sometimes but never followed through... hardly enough development for all the trials the characters have been through. The characters are vehicles for the plot which shouldn't be the case. The characters should be informing the plot, not making generic decisions with no personality, just to further the plot along. All the characters just lack dimension and personality. Especially Rachel and Baam. And they are arguably the more important characters... So, overall 5/10 is pretty generous considering my ratings for characters and my enjoyment of the series. I just don't want to rate it 4/10 because ToG isn't 'bad' per say, rather just not for me since I enjoy stories with good character development, which ToG did not have. I am also older than the target audience (10-15 year olds?) so that might be a factor limiting my enjoyment as well. However, I can understand why someone who doesn't mind mindlessly consuming manga/manhwa that has a semblance of a plot and characters can enjoy ToG. It is readable. Just mediocre."}, {"score": "2", "content": "Tower of God has been a hot topic for quite some time and anywhere you went you would stumble upon people recommending and praising it like it's the best written thing ever which is far from the truth. Very, very far. ToG starts off with an introduction of Rachel who wants to climb the tower in order to see a sky, stars and whatnot. After she disappears from Bam's sight in a flash of light Bam vows that he'll follow her till death and his climb in order to meet up with her once again- begins. This premise doesn't sound so interesting on it's own and in ... order for it to be captivating and compelling it needs good characters. Unfortunately, Tower of God has none so the whole reading experience feels like a chore. It was painfull, slow and boring to read that I regretted the day I began reading it. I mean, I gave it more than a fair chance, but after 50 chapters seeing how nothing changes and how its still boring and uninteresting, I just had to stop reading it. Now, there's a bunch of people saying how it gets good later on, but no one has the time or willpower to sit through dozens and dozens (or maybe even hundreds) of chapters hoping it might get good. Bam, like every other character in this series is so uninteresting, forgettable and shallow that I couldn't care less about him. To make things even worse, author overloads you with a bunch of characters like these to the point of skipping some of their dialogue just so you could get them out of sight. There is not a lot to talk about art because it's more than terrible. It's horrendous. It looks like some fanfic drawn by a twelve years old kid. All in all, Tower of God is more than an overrated, generic shounen filled with terrible, one-dimensional characters, plot that moves at snail pace and horrendous art."}, {"score": "4", "content": "I read the full season one and half season 2 of Tower God a few days ago so I will give you my honest thoughts about it here. I first heard of this manhwa becoming an anime not too long ago from Joey (AKA The Anime Man) and wanted to check it out straight away, instead of waiting every week for all episodes to fully air. Basically when I first read all 78 chapters (season 1) of this manhwa, I actually thought it was quite decent at first . Rak and Khun were the most likeable pair I've come across in the series. It's always ... adorable when Rak always calls everyone different types of \"Turtles\" and going over the top with things. Khun was like this chilled out dude with a slick style and whom you really want to be friends with, and even him falling out with Rak numerous of times for various stupid reasons, was absolutely hilarious! In all honesty, I had no time for Bam because he was always just non-stop talks about Rachel and he was just such a headache to look at lol! SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU HAVE NOT READ SEASON 2 YET So fast forward to reading season 2.... It was a serious hot mess tbh.... They added in pointless numerous characters who don't add up to the story and story was just all over the friggin shop with non stop repeating itself!! They even got rid of most of the old crew but when they kept a few such as Bam (who you know I don't like but still) and Khun, they are completely different characters altogether! I felt their personalities abruptly changed which I honestly hated, especially Khuns! Also no Rak so that made my reading experience pretty frustrating and that resulted in me dropping the season altogether at 27 chapters... Very disappointed but yeah we can't like every single webtoon out there lads! I don't care if you disagree with my opinion or not but this wasnt the best manhwa I've ever read to be quite frank with ya! To end on a more positive note with my negative review, the opening song of this in the anime adaption is pretty lit!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "This is going to be my first time writing a review for anything, I'll try my best not to sound like a fangirl gah STORY 10/10 Definitely the best part of the whole webtoon! The first time I read this, I was in awe by how complex the world-building for this story was. From the characters, the team positions (light bearer, scout, etc.), to the history and mysteries of the tower. The first time I reread this, I was amazed by all the details and how everything is connected with each other. Small details in the first chapters would be hints to something important that would be revealed ... later on. SIU is a genius TT ART 9.5/10 I admit I'm one of those people who procrastinated in reading this at first because of the art. If you're of them, then STOP PUTTING IT OFF AND READ IT NOW or you'll regret it! The art has improved exponentially since the first episode and is still continuing to improve! I always wonder how they manage to release those long af episodes with those detailed coloring every. week. CHARACTERS 8.5/10 ToG has amazing characters that are well-written, very interesting, and lovable personalities. I love seeing how some of the characters develop, especially Baam, Khun, and Rachel. I also really love the dynamics between a lot of the characters like Rakhunbam, Khun-Hatz, Anaak-Ran, etc. Their interactions are so entertaining to read! I just think there are some issues with how the series handles some of its characters. Like, they introduce these really interesting characters that get me really hyped, but after several episodes, they become kind of... bland? They become treated as background characters and even lose their personality. I know its because new characters keep on getting introduced which makes it impossible for SIU to focus on these characters but idk, I just feel inconsistency for a lot of characters in the series;; SPOILER-ish: I'm talking about characters like Boro and Hoaquin. They were characters that start off really cool and intimidating, then they become characters that are just,,, there. They get bits of lines every now and then, they fight when they are needed, but they lost the charm they had when they first appeared. OVERALL 9/10 Tower of God was one of the first webtoons I've ever read and still remains my most favorite one today. Its the kind of series that I wish I could forget and read all over again because the experience of reading it for the first time will never compare to whenever I reread the whole series. I think the only thing this series needs to work on is the characters, and sometimes I think the 'comedy' bits get a little stale tbh, but overall its such a good read that I'd definitely recommend to shounen fans. Its a perfect mix of action, adventure, mystery, drama, and even has themes of psychology and philosophy! Tip for new readers: I personally prefer to read ToG in bulk chapters, reading one chapter every week is too painful. I also recommend rereading the whole thing at least once after you caught up to the latest chapter, you'll realize how much details were put into making this webtoon and will make you appreciate it more! Lastly, I recommend visiting the Tower of God wiki because there are lots of additional info. in there that wasn't really said in the webtoon. Have fun reading!"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Frequently dubbed \"the One Piece of manhwa\" by the animanga community, this 10-year old series is undoubtedly a legend in itself, a giant in the manhwa industry, and for very good reasons. For me, a story that can match ToG are very few and far between. Story: 10/10 | Art: 9/10 | Character: 9/10 | Enjoyment: 10/10 | Overall: 10/10 What I like best about ToG: In terms of Worldbuilding, from SIU's blogposts, you can see how much dedication he has given to it, to the extent of laying down plots and characters that appear 6-8 years later in the story. I love discussing these ... mysteries with the community. Theme-wise, I'd compare it to the level of Shingeki no Kyojin (AoT), for its more serious narration & setting (with a dash of occasional humour), the cruel undertone that permeates the society, the diversity in character perspectives, the moral ambiguity, the mystery, and how the plot progresses. Just my cup of tea. This review is from the perspective of a fan who've been reading this since 2015. I will tell you why to me, this series stood out among the 50+ manga and manhwas I've read, analyse the good, the bad, the phenomenal, the most common complaints and praises of the series, and the reasons why so many readers are addicted to it. Personally, I think the 3 strongest points of Tower of God are: 1. World Building, As part of the bigger Talse Uzer Story, The Tower has its own lore, history, rules, hierarchal system, power struggles between factions, and characters with their own lives, triumphs and setbacks. There is further differences between each floor, and it is hinted that the world outside the tower is completely different. The world is mind-bogglingly huge, and it is an enjoyment to find out more about it. Wiki is your best friend. There is no \"average villain\", every arc is unique in plot, story, characters, and setting. Yet, they do not feel like a filler because they have a role in the overarching story, which leads back to the main plot line. 2. Mystery, where the reader follows the main character into this unknown world, to find out what happened to the Tower in the past 10,000+ years, that lead to what it is today. There's no end to discussion with the community, especially on discord. As the story progresses, more and more mysteries are unveiled, but just enough to keep you on your toes, and ask more questions. How much you immerse in the universe, I feel, is the biggest difference between \"addicted\" readers and most other readers. Readers who enjoy discussing the hints, mysteries, and predicting the story seems far more likely to enjoy the series than a casual reader. Discussing and asking questions in the community, such as the r/towerofgod discord community, really makes a difference. 3. Plot, where a coherent storyline is planned out many years in advance, and the author seemingly never run out of materials. Since the beginning, it has shifted from Hunter x Hunter / My Hero Academia style of lessons and tests, to One Piece style of world building, and to Shingeki no Kyojin style of ideological / political fights and wars. As of 2020, it has published for 10 years, and is still going very strong. Personally, I'd add a few more points: 4. Moral ambiguity, Tower of God has some thought provoking themes as it goes along, this is not a typical \"the MC and those who help him can do nothing wrong\" series. Throughout the story, the MC have received help from outright villainous characters, who often have their own motivations. Even as we learn about their back story, most do not try to justify their actions with \"sob stories\", nor are they portrayed as unreasonable, insane people. This is what I like about this, and what makes it stand out from other typical \"shonen\" series. There is no clear \"good\" or \"bad\" side, yet the story doesn't harp on it, but integrate it naturally into the culture of the Tower. 5. Themes Some notable themes for characters in this story, include \"devotion\", and \"fighting fate\". I enjoyed how SIU explored the theme of \"devotion\" outside of romantic feelings, by elaborating the emotions, thoughts, experiences, behaviours and nuances when it comes to desires. Fate is another theme in this story, where individuals fight to free themselves from shackles imposed onto them by a higher establishment. It can become very gruesome, yet it is not the run of the mill \"tragic\" story. Oppression is well elaborated and not \"forced\" onto the story. As a person who grew up under an oppressive government, I really appreciated the realism that is portrayed. Lastly, as a female reader, I appreciated the relative lack of female character sexualisation and obsession on \"boobs\", similar to Shingeki no Kyojin. Female characters are often ranked among the strongest of the Tower inhabitants, and have their own unique character, as well as important contribution to the progress of the story. Moving on, the 3 most common complaints of Tower of God are: 1. Too many? characters, not enough development for some side characters: Tower of God is of the Epic Fantasy genre, which naturally features a large cast. While it is beloved for its diverse cast of side characters, it can also be a downside to some who have difficulty remembering everything. Although it's not something that can't be resolved with wiki and some discussion or questions on discord and reddit. Due to the nature of the story, where the Tower is a big place (with 134 known floors the size of the American continent), and the fact that the MC is far stronger and needs to grow quickly to defeat the ultimate archenemy, eventually some side characters will fade away from central storyline. It can be sad to get attached to a side character who has relatable backstory and motives, but then the character doesn't show up for 2-3 years. As the plot progresses, more new characters are introduced for their role in the story. This can be an upside for those who enjoy the world building (and more new favourite characters!), but a downside for those who prefer sticking to familiar characters. Still, many side characters are still very well loved for their design, character development, and their role in the story. On discord, there's a sizeable number of fans who join the \"teams\" for side characters, and that speaks a lot. 2. Art (season 1) Everyone knows that the drawings didn't start off well, but it does tremendously improve. (see: imgur.com/gallery/fxbQdYW) It started with amateurish anatomy, by around 80-150 chapters, it has already improved beyond recognition, with refined colouring and style that takes your breath away, on par with the best of mangas. The series is fully coloured which is its strong point, well loved for its details, as well as the fact that the characters actually change their clothes. But having read many other works with much cleaner action scenes, some fighting scenes can come off as slightly confusing due to the vertical format of the Webtoons, and some 3D modelled ships can seem to have flat textures. The artist was also injured for a while and you can see the art style evolve through different arcs. Regardless, I'd give this an 9/10 for its excellent art, and it's fighting scenes are still great. 3. Plot & Power scaling A big bottleneck for this series is the early Hell Train Station arc (around post chapter 200), where some people agree that the plot became unbearably slow, even when reread. It seemed like SIU took feedback from his readers that the previous arc was \"too fast paced\", and tried to adjust it, which in my opinion didn't turn out well. If you can last through that arc, imo the best is yet to come. All my favourite arcs are after that. Because of how the story itself evolves through different themes and segments of the Tower, some may lament that what initially attracted them to the story is not the main focus now. But the story has something for everyone. There are those who are still very fond of the wit and epicness of S1 and early S2, despite how long ago it was. Some enjoy the later seasons, for the characters, world building, mystery, art, thought provoking conflicts and much more. The Power scaling and progression had also came to question, as the story progresses to include more and more characters from the upper echelons of the tower. While earlier battles relied more on tactics and tricks, later on it sometimes felt like a spam of flashy moves. Regardless, it simply reflects the overwhelming power difference as one moves up the tower, and many are happy to have epic scenes like these. i.imgur.com/eI1URJZ.jpg In conclusion, you will probably love Tower of God if: 1. You enjoy epic / dark fantasy and discussing about the mysteries. 2. You like diverse characters, with moral ambiguities and different perspectives. 3. You like political fights and the journey towards toppling the establishment. Hope you find Tower of God as addictive as we do!"}, {"score": "3", "content": "Unpopular opinion here, Tower of God is overrated and the attention the anime seems to receive is going to be short-lived. Note that I'm writing this review, having read the webtoon for many years but decided to drop it. At first, the story seems really captivating in the beginning. A character named Bam is trying to reach the top of the tower, to have his wish granted. Not to mention, Bam's relationship with Rachel. All these are really interesting to start off a series like this. However, the concept of reaching top of tower isn't exactly new or really thought provoking, hell even SAO did ... it already. Characters need to progress through levels in the tower to reach a specific goal, sound familiar? What SIU does well is presenting his ideas, in his own image, to the world via the form of webtoon. Sadly, the story/plot gets forgotten really fast after the first arc or I could say first 50 to 80 chapters of the Tower of God webtoon. Suddenly theres no coherent plot or even story telling. The author at that point is just mindlessly introducing an endless amount of concept and ideas, which sadly fails to build upon a story unless you are willing to religiously dedicate your time to it hoping somehow it will be fulfilling which it never does. Exposition after exposition, nothing seems to capture readers like it did in the first few chapters. Character interaction just doesn't seem to build upon anything and is just downright bland. The anime so far is sticking close to its source material which I hope the studio is able to wrap it up in the last few episodes. Art-style, while its typical webtoon, don't expect much. I'd argue other webtoons are much more worthy of your time; God of Highschool, The Gamer, Hardcore Leveling, Solo leveling, Girls of the wild) I honestly think that people are mistaking a good story with endless exposition of ideas. But you might argue, if its so bad, why is it so popular? Well this is just my opinion. Being popular doesn't exclude the fact that it can be bad or boring. TOG is just the result of SIU imaginations which doesn't deliver much in terms of story or character interaction. I regret having spent so much time reading the TOG webtoon expecting it to deliver an experience which it probably never will. The only thing good about the TOG anime that is really making it interesting, for me at least, are the voice actors. Anything else, is just due to the source material being downright boring.

I will mostly be pointing out flaws and things that annoyed me while reading so the score I gave might come off as conflicting in regards to the review itself, but I ... really do enjoy reading this on a weekly basis despite all its flaws and I think a majority of people would too which is why I'm scoring it a 10/10. So my favorite aspect of this Manwha and the reason I do enjoy it so much is the world building. SIU has managed to create a world that has so much going on it truly feels alive. There is so much information and little details about it (both in the manwha itself and a lot of information you can gather outside of it) that it really does feel like we could follow any other characters in the world and it'd still be a very engaging story. The world does revolve around our main cast the same way it usually does in a lot of shounen work, however if the main cast were to be taken out of the story it still feels like the world would keep spinning and there would still be stories to be told. As far as the story itself goes it is too complex to briefly explain. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. On the one hand there are a lot of intricacies in the story, and when you notice them it certainly feels like every little thing lead to this conclusion for a reason. However, it also makes the story hard to follow sometimes. It tends to jump all over the place and the pacing is very inconsistent. Certain arcs feel like they drag on for way too long when the conclusion is already obvious, while other arcs (or perhaps certain fights, more specifically) go by in a blur and it feels like you missed out when there are a lot of loose ends left by the end of it. Despite all this, the story has certainly been engaging and up to a certain point it felt like there was always something at stake. This Manwha however has the typical power-creep problem a lot of shounen has. This leads us into the magic system. So the magic system in Tower of God is set up with different roles being presented. Every role has something they specify in which is their strength, and to be able to climb the tower efficiently you'd need a full team of all the different roles to complete and compensate for each other's flaws. This system clearly had a lot of thought put into it and a lot of the early chapters put in a great deal of information explaining it all. Unfortunately this is all thrown out the window after a certain point and it is once more about who can shoot the bigger explosions at each other. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it feels wasteful when so much time was put into a very interesting magic system. This has however had a great impact on the art, which has been improving chapter by chapter. Comparing some of the early chapters to the recent ones are night and day and all the big blasts and explosions compliment the great art very well. The character drawings are definitely not anything to scuff at either so overall the art is good. Speaking about the characters, there are a lot of them. I mean a LOT of them. And again, this is both a good thing and a bad thing. It adds to the world building that there is so much going on at any one point. But because a lot of them do not get a lot of exposure it makes them feel unmemorable. Another issue with it is that due to the length of the Manwha and that the arcs aren't laid out in a traditional sense you often tend to forget characters that later return. What I mean by this is unlike other works where the story might move from one place to another leaving characters behind and finding new ones as they move along Tower of God is set up so everyone is working towards the same goal. All the characters move forward albeit at their own pace but towards a common goal so characters tend to reappear perhaps years later in real time. If five or ten characters suddenly reappear two years later and they never got that much exposure in the first place it feels very understandable the reader would not be able to remember them. At least not remember their personal plot lines which often times would just pick up and continue as if you read about the in the previous chapter. The main cast however feels very well developed. They get enough time put into them that you are able to understand their personal motivations/reasons for moving forward and so on. None of them are super special or anything, but cool and memorable enough to make for a good cast of characters. Overall I think Tower of God suffers from a lot of problems that most webtoons tend to suffer from. Why this is the case I think is really hard to answer, but it is by far the most polish work out there. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time and if nothing else it is a beautiful battle Manwha that I think will be worth your time."}, {"score": "4", "content": "Hey, I know a lot of people are going to disagree with this post due to the fact that I am putting a negative review on this anime but I have some good reasons to back this up.

The story is very lack luster and does not explain that much of why the characters are going up the tower and why the actual hell was Bam and Rachel are in a Cave to begin with? (Never Explains this in the Webtoon) 2. The characters are some what genuine on how they portray themselves but do it in a ... pace that makes it an eye sore to focus on. (Webtoon is the same) 3.

You can predict everything that happens because nothing happens. There is no suspense here because there is no plot. There is no reason to read this because it has been done much better in other stories. The action is crude and simplistic. If you ... want to read something fun with interesting characters then try Naruto."}, {"score": "10", "content": "First time writing a review, so here it comes. TOWER OF GOD. Story 10/10 The story is so entertaining, interesting, and one of the best crafted stories I've ever read in all of my years reading mangas, manhwas, and even novels. I can't believe that a simple premise as \"climbing tower\" would be much more than that. The lore and mysteries is definitely one of the best as well. The series can be a bit slow at times because of the set-ups for the stories but the pay-off will definitely make up for it. Though the set-ups are mostly entertaining and interesting as well. Hunter x Hunter ... is the most similar show to TOG. Art 6.5/10 (first season) to 9/10 (second season and beyond) The first season's art isn't the greatest but it still manages to deliver what it's supposed to portray and after getting used to it, you won't even realize that the art is mediocre once you get invested on its story and it's characters. But it's still mediocre The second season is when the art improves (might be due to having assistants) and it really portrays how the author(SIU) grows as an artists. there are plenty of beautiful arts here and there but there will be still bland/normal looking arts here and there. But it still gets the job done in the portrayal of the characters, setting and the story. Character 10/10 Characters is one of the strongest points in this manhwa. The vast casts and each having different goals, personalities, strength, quirks, principles,is what separates it from most of the other stories out there. Each are unique, and interesting in their own way. The actions of these characters in different situations is what drives the story moving forward. Enjoyment 10/10 Reading has never been this one hell of a ride as TOG. All the twists and turns, actions, psychological aspect, interesting characters, mystery and hype moments keeps me from not reading TOG every week.The comedies here and there are still hilarious even after rereads. Overall 10/10 This is definitely a must read/must watch(if anime is available) and I highly recommend this. The length of the chapter might make you hesitant but trust me, when you read it and start to get to it, you would want it to be a lot longer than it is."}, {"score": "1", "content": "WARNING ! SPOILERS AHEAD! I heard about this manhwa when there was an announcement saying two webtoons getting an anime adaptation for the first time, so it got my attention and I gave it a try. The whole story beginned with a wonderful start. Amazing characters, incredible worldbuilding, plot twists, etc. I was intrigued as I kept reading. And I have to admit it, it really was a series as great as \"Hunter x Hunter\". But as the time passed, many characters started to lose their majority and uniqueness. And there is also the toxic fanbase problem. If you can't tolerate a fanbase wasting their ... whole time for yaoi ships or throwing hate and love for some characters don't ever start this manhwa. Also after some point storyline drops quality and becomes very predictable.This manhwa has very big pros and cons. Thought I can't tolerate many things of the \"Tower of God\", I still kept reading it. But I can't stand it anymore. If I could the define this manhwa I would say \"How to Ruin a Masterpiece\". There is no hope neither future for Tower of God. Don't give me hope. So these things I said right now were my overall thoughts about the series. Now I'll be touching upon each element of the manhwa, plus I will also be specially write something about a few characters that I want to mention. Season 1: Season 1 was pretty impressive. Thanks to SIU, we realized a great story won't need great drawings to make it good. A twist ending, interesting characters and an unusual worldbuilding. Season 2: I really don't know how to put Season 2 to words, since there were so many arcs it contained. I won't be evaluating the overall story but it had a major importance for the manhwa. %50 of the \"Tower of God\" story was comprised in this season. We met many of the major characters and faced the driving forces of the story here. So it's definitely better than 1st season. Season 3: Season 3 had the worst arc as the beginning. Deng Deng Arc was absolutely trash and cliché. It had a story which has already been used for the manhwa several times, \"save the kid arc\". But I really liked the later arc, Nest. It has a good potential and might grow into a vital part of the story. Story: The story in overall is incredible. The whole idea of fitting the whole world of the manhwa in a gigantic tower is absolutely a never seen before idea. Yet many later arcs share similarities and gets boring after a point( in many arcs, the main motive is usually obtaining some sort of item or saving someone). Althought, really liked the first arc, Workshop Battle, Hell Train etc. Another bad thing about the story is that it can sometimes be full nonsense. For example, in the beginning of the workshop battle arc, it has been mentioned for many times that the battle is gonna be pretty dangerous, thought our heroes managed to leave the arc with only a few injuries. Also, near the start of Hell Train arc, Hwaryun said to Bam that \"this is a place where you must sacrifice to go on\" and similar things for many times. But he only ended up losing two people(which there wasn't anything he could do about) and I won't be counting the part where he couldnt save Yuri and Jinsung from getting imprisoned, because it was Zahard's act and had nothing to with the train. Worldbuiding and lore: The lore of Tower of God is massive. I believe there might not be an end to it, including the notes SIU shared about the Tower's structure, characters , etc. We currently don't have enough information whether how big tower really is, and also don't know what exactly does the outside world looks like. I really loved this part of \"Tower of God\". Cast: The worst thing about this manhwa is,I believe the character cast. Bam is a pretty short phrased protagonist compared to any others in any manga or anime. Although I've been reading this manhwa for a long time, I really don't have an idea what kind of person is Bam precisely. It's obvious he is a caring and compassionate character but he is sometimes suprisingly mad. And I really don't think SIU is showing enough of Bam's personality, his inner voice or overall thoughts. Which makes it hard for the audience to symphatize for the main character. For the rest of the cast, including the side characters, I believe there aren't many good-written characters at all. There sure can be fan-favorite characters but, they are nothing more than fanservice. Khun and Rachel ( An Especial Situation): I won't be talking about the relationship between these characters, but I will be talking about the overall opinions and thoughts I have for them. Starting from Khun, he used to be my favorite character since the very start, but I believe Khun got very screwed since his obsession with Bam, started to think about nothing but Bam. Which leads to unhealthy fangirls to ruin the quality of tower of god fanbase. I don't care if Khun cares about Bam, but him being abnormally obsessed with him ( in many parts of the story he does a lotta things for Bam), but I really believe he is pretty ruined. For Rachel, she is the only character im neutral with. I do hated her at the season 1 finale, and when she stabbed Ran's legs, murdered Akraptor also led Prince to get eaten, but in overall she really isn't a bad girl . In stark contrast, I believe she is the most fitting character for audience to symphatize. She is a natural character. Didn't you ever had simple dreams, yet were so big for you, and that you would give anything for turning those dreams true ? She might be a b*tch but she definitely is a strongly-written character. I'm very sure she will have even greater majority in the future chapters."}, {"score": "10", "content": "I finally have a chance to pitch in a vote for my absolute favorite webtoon. Over the years i have picked up series and enjoyed them. I've gotten obsessed with keeping up with all sorts of manga and then grown bored with them weeks or months later.

The only series that I've been keeping up with for years and still get excited week per week for goes to this magnificent piece of art. Please do yourself a service and ... read this. I promise you wont regret it if you have any misgivings about the art know it gets vastly better."}, {"score": "3", "content": "This series is riddled with problems. One of them is the characters. The characters are very retarded. They also talk a lot in exposition, which is completely stupid as that is not how actual people talk. Whether it's dialogue or monologue, the exposition is used to dump information which may be important to the story sometimes, but is mostly useless garbage. Also, the author decided to ditch the original side characters of Season 1, like Anak and instead brought in a lot of others. That itself would not constitute a bad thing, but unfortunately, we don't come to care for these secondary characters. I couldn't ... care two hoots about these characters if I wanted to. Not only do they not appear long enough for us to care about them, they are also badly written. There's so many of these insignificant characters in Seasons 2 and 3 that I've lost count. The vast majority of them don't even have any influence on the plot. Adding to this is the complete lack of character development for most characters, making things worse. The characters also don't have consistent motivations and many characters also change their personalities out of nowhere. One minute they are ruthlessly killing their own teammates and smiling while doing so and in the next, they are crying \"how could you?\" at the villain for killing their mother. The only well written character in the entire series is Rachel and I haven't seen her even once in Season 3. The next problem is the story which initially had an interesting and promising premise, but quickly went the uninteresting shounen way. Shounens themselves are not bad, HxH is a very good example of a shounen. This story is extremely bad due to the way it is excecuted. Two things were incorporated which made things worse - the power of friendship from Naruto and Dragon Ball Z style attacks. The fights only have flashy shinsoo light explosions now. There's no intelligence to the fights. Another huge problem is the excessive focus on Baam, who is the typical angelic and flawless shounen MC. In ToG, whenever you get an interesting premise for an arc, 90% of the arc will be about power levels and how special Bam is, with the villain then getting two pages worth of back story after he's defeated and the arc ends. That's a problem with with plot and characterisation at once. The plot has been going nowhere since Season 2 and I'm not even sure there's a plot to the story anymore, there no longer seems to be an end goal. The first Season was rather nice, had quite a lot of potential. But man the 2nd season was a bore. The story after the workshop arc was such a pain. I had to force myself to read through it. I've hadn't read something so boring and generic for such a long time. ToG is essentially a series which had potential, but squandered it terribly. I don't think the series is worth investing time into. There are way better series out there that you can read instead. Overall, completely overrated and not worth investing time in."}, {"score": "1", "content": "SPOILERS****************************** I made an account just to write a review about this garbage manhwa. This is the most pathetic manhwa I have ever red. The art is not that great in the beginning, but it improvers a bit later. The main issue I have is with it's mc. He is such a pathetic piece of shit. Initially the plot was that the mc was chasing a girl who wants to go to the top of the tower, but later we learn that she wants to kill the mc. She attempts to kill him, but he somehow survives. At this point anyone will think that she must ... have a really strong reason to betray mc and the mc will take revenge for betrayal, but NO the reason for the girl to go to the top of the tower is so that she can watch some stars and wants to steal the identity of mc as a prophecy child and this shitty mc forgives her and still chases after her. Later this girl kills the companions of mc's best friend who spent 7yrs to find mc and take revenge for what she has done to him, but again this mc forgives her. Later again she kills 2 of the mc's friends and even almost kill him(in the hell train arc), but again he forgives her(even though he says that they are enemies, but still this shitty mc definitely don't think of her as an enemy. I will explain it next ). The mc keeps on putting the life of his friends in danger and gets them killed, just so that he can go back with that girl. In the next arc the girl wants to find an item to get stronger and mc continues his chase for the girl, but he also wants that item to get stronger. The mc's friends again put their life on the line so that mc can get a power upgrade and when he finally gets the item, this pathetic ass mc goes to girl and says that it wasn't fair for him to keep the item and wants to compete to decide who will be it's owner. During the search for the item the girl gets poisoned and the mc was given a chance to wish for anything, but you must have already guessed what this pathetic simp mc would have wished, if not then he wishes to cure the girl. This girl is also so garbage, she doesn't do anything on her own and uses the ability of others to go up the tower. Pls don't waste your time on this fucking shit manhwa. The name of the manhwa should be \"Tower of simp\"."}, {"score": "10", "content": "This will be my first written review of this platform and will be taken by what is considered by many to be the best manhwa: 10/10 story: wonderful just that, Siu is a genius when it comes to creating a story that catches you from the first chapter read, for many it seemed boring to me, the story enchanted me, as if he is revealing us little by little Little the mysteries of the world of TOG ES is simply incredible, this is one of the few mangakas as well as an ode that tells you an event in chapter 1 and it is not if ... not within 100 chapters that reveals it, that makes for me tower of god be one of the best manhwas par excellence art, here I will divide it into two: first season 3/10, it was disgusting the truth, why deny it, the characters and almost everything seemed to be with paint and it is understandable since Siu at first was disgusting drawing, I think the only thing it goes down that he drew were the scenarios but nothing else. Second and third season 9.5: my goodness, but here the thing changes, the drawing, the lines, the art of siu gives a tremendous high, that makes it more enjoyable to continue reading the story Characters 8.5: all the characters are well-worn, well-worked, and with a back story that makes you adore them unconditionally, they all have their moment to shine, here is not only the leading role that stands out, to be honest there are characters who are better at personality and stand out more than the protagonist himself and that is good, it is not like others that have been read where the protagonist is the center of attention, literally the protagonist can die and history will go its own way. Enjoy 10/10: to some it may seem slow or boring, but for me it is the opposite, each chapter that I see fills me more and more with emotion, I cannot find it piece read more than 80 or 100 pages, and at the end a chapter I feel like reading more. Overall 9.5 / 10: He said, and if I gave it a low rating with everything written, I would be commenting on sacrilege and offending one of the best stories I'm reading."}, {"score": "10", "content": "This will be my first and only review , because ToG is such a special reading for me , it's unique, it has alot of characters to simpatize with, the artstyle changes through time in a ridiculous insane good way..

It doesnt feel rushed in mostly of times, the introduction of new characters is great and so the process of them gaining new powers and so on , the fighting panels are understandble and ToG never loses its own way about ... what it wants to show for the reader.

Have fun reading ToG !"}, {"score": "4", "content": "I was introduced to Tower of God through the recent introduction of its anime adaptation. I hadn't heard much of it before that and what I did hear was always positive so I delved into the anime with pretty high expectations. I was immediately drawn in by the setting and world of TOG. The story follows the mysterious protagonist, Baam, into the Tower of God and follows his journey of climbing the tower. The world building is compelling, and the story pulls you in with its unanswered questions. Which is why its so dissapointing to say that after reading almost 400 chapters of TOG, I ... can say that those questions I had? Are still unanswered. All of them. This story doesn't go anywehere. Story: 3/10 Ignore what I said earlier about the TOG being compelling. This is your run-of-the-mill typical shonen story. There's a bit of momentum carrying it forward at the beginning with the main protagonist being thrust into an unfamiliar environment. I even think the first season ends off on a pretty strong note. But then season 2 hits, and my mind goes blank if you try to ask me to mention anything of praise from there. At the end of almost every arc, I had to ask myself: what was the point of all that? Couldn't we have just skipped all that and the story would have been left unchanged? And the answer to that question is almost always yes. The second season goes on for 300-something chapters and I can think of one, ONE, major plot development. An entire 8 years worth of chapters could have been replaced with a single arc, and nothing would have changed. And this isn't even mentioning the metric tonne of dropped plot threads, half due to the ever fattening amoeba that is Baam's team of forgettables (more on that later). The whole story is littered with random developments, that serve nothing to the overarching plot, and seem to be made up on the go and are later dropped, never to be heard from again. It was pretty evident to me when reading, that the author had no clear direction when writing the story, and each story arc seemed to be just a way for the protagonist to get a cool new powerup, without anything really happening. Art: 5/10 I'll be lenient here and just ignore the quality of the art from season 1. I almost dropped the manhwa because the quality of the art was so off-putting. The art does significantly improve in later chapters, but just know, that if you're a stickler for good art, you're going to have to wait a hell of a long time before it even resembles anything mediocre. There isn't really anything significant to be said about the art to be honest. At best its meh, and at worst, it puts a grimace on my face. The backgrounds and landscapes lack any modicum of detail or thought. Typically just two-color blue or grey blurry images that hide behind the characters (which is really unfortunate, with a world as much potential as TOG, the background scenes could have been a very strong tool and medium of storytelling). The fight scenes are confusing, as I don't understand what's going on half the time beacuse they consist of 4 consecutive panels of random splashes of colour which do nothing to explain what the heck is happening. Overall, the art isn't unbearable, but it certainly isn't anything noteworthy. Characters: 2/10 This is easily where TOG falls flat on its face. It's amazing how many characters are in the story, and yet at the same time there are no characters. Rather than developing a few characters to push the narrative forward, the author seems to be content throwing a bunch of flat, one-dimensional characters in your face, telling you to look at the cool special ability they have. Even the characters that do get some development are half-baked at best and are later forgotten about like the rest of the crew. And there are. So. Many. Of. Them. Almost all the characters are just props in the story, that serve as \"friends that the main character needs to protect\". And they just keep coming. With each new arc, a whole slew of new randoms get jammed into the already conflated cast, and some old ones are thrown in the dumpster, never to be mentioned again. You know, your story has too many characters when you could cull half of them, and the story would remain completely UNCHANGED. And don't even get me started on our beloved main hero, Baam. This boy is one of the most generic, self-insert, boring protagonists, bordering on Kirito levels of blandness. His whole character boils down to \"I have to get stronger to protect my friends\". I can't even give you an accurate description of his personality, because he flip-flops so much throughout the story for no apparent reason like a moody teenager. He has no clear and consistent motivations to drive the plot forward, no real conflicts that enable character growth, not even a BACKSTORY to relate to. Everything about Baam screams blank, power fantasy character with the depth of a kitchen sink. The story is filled to the brim with characters like these, who serve as action figures to play out a scene, rather than as actual people who drive the plot. The only reason this doesn't get a 1 is because I think some of the character designs are pretty alright. Enjoyment: 4/10 Despite everything, I still think there are things that the 14-year old shonen lover in me found enjoyable. If TOG has anything going for it, its the interesting and unique concepts that it presents to the reader. However filled with inconsistencies, and underdeveloped those concepts may be, it was still cool to read. Overall, I'm pretty disapointed with TOG. I wanted it to be good, because the concept on paper was compelling and filled with potential. But alas, what we got was a half-baked mess, filled with logical inconsistencies, unfinished plot-threads, and a bland cast of characters. I can't find myself recommending this to aynone, unless your a fan of the shonen formula and have a lot of free time on your hands."}, {"score": "1", "content": "I started reading tower of god pretty much when it was at about 50 chapters, and have been reading it on and off since then, sadly with every time i go back to reading it i enjoy it less and less, after over 400 chapters it feels like little to no development has been made no matter the training or hardships the MC always feels like he's lacking, which translates to him constantly in need to be saved by someone/somehow which makes accompanying his story very disappointing, at times the highlight of the story is the side characters which do feel unique but are just ... thrown always/forgotten and with the vast amount of characters being introduced if you end up liking a side character it might take over an year to see them again, with more and more manhwas being introduced, tower of god has not been innovating/making a good story/ character/progress to justify picking it over something else.

So take what you read below with a grain of salt. Also no spoilers. This series took forever to end up on MAL because what MAL attributes to an actual series is something that is published/aired on TV/showcased in a theater. Dumbasses. HOWEVER we now have this series on MAL and a freaking anime adaptation coming out soon to boot. Until the series has concluded, I'm just going to write down my current thoughts on the series so far. Tower of God has been, for the past 4 or so years, been ... my number one shounen story. Yes, this Korean Manhwa is very much a shounen. It showcases the struggle of one boy as he continues to hone his skills. He meets many friends whom he, at many points in the story, helps on their journey to the top of this crazy ass tower. That's a fucking shounen dawg. Speaking of the tower, the world in general in this story is crazy detailed amazing. The world building is absolutely top notch. Even in sections where the author isn't going out of his way to fully flesh out the surroundings, you pick up on it whether it is the artwork or dialogue from the characters. The artwork starts out dog ass. Yes it isn't that appealing to look at for the first 50 or so chapters. SIU, the creator of this story, obviously had growing pains with the artstyle for a good while. However, it very much improves over time and from season 2 onward, the artwork is fantastic. The character designs are amazing as well. Each character looks so unique and they match the tone they are expelling in all scenes. I'm like, super deep into the chapters (I tend to catch up, wait a year, then re-read all the way up to the current chapter) and I can say that this is my most favorite written media thing that I've read in the past 10 or so years. It does drag a little bit towards the middle/end of season 2 but not at all enough to make me bored of it all together. This really is a fantastic piece of work and anyone who loves shounen anime/manga owes it to yourself to read this."}, {"score": "4", "content": "Many people recommended this manhwa but i never picked it up before since i didnt really like the art style, and i can travel back in time, i'll slap my past self for reading through 400 chapters of it just because some random guy said it gets better. Sure, it does get better, but its only better because the first season is just so horrible that it makes even mediocre seasons after it become somewhat better. Even among manhwas, its far from being one of the best, there are a lot of better manhwas than it, even the isekai/resurrection manhwas with around ... 20-30 chapters have more plot than it. Story 3/10: the author had a good start with our protagonist being mysterious and all to get people to keep reading to find out his past, but from there on, it just keeps going downhill, i've read 400 chapters and still dont know anything noteworthy, the storytelling is poor, the author tries to tell us the stories of so many characters and trials/trainings at a time, and surprisingly none of them is interesting, and then the main plot never gets anywhere because all of these side stories keep overwhelm it. Art 7/10: the art at the start is also horrible, the characters look like theyre made on MS paint, but it does get better after some 100 chapters or so, and its also the only thing that rly gets better in this manhwa, although the character poses are still stiff even after 400 chapters. Characters 3/10: the worst part of this manhwa, the main character of the story is mysterious, and he remain so even after 4 seasons, we dont know anything about him aside from a few things from his past, he started off as the \"i will get stronger to protect all my friends\" protagonist just like in shounen manga, but he never gets anything more than that, he rarely shows emotions and rarely says anything. The main antagonist is even worse, for a bad guy, the main antagonist of the series have the worst reason ever to become a bad guy, and just like the protagonist, we rarely know anything about her except for her being mediocre. All characters other than the main guy and the main bad guy are basically there to be part of the crowd, even though the author tells a lot of side stories about these characters, we never even get a chance to get attached to them, because when the author is done telling their stories, they're thrown away to make room for new side characters, this thing happened every season. Enjoyment 3/10: i read this because i ran out of manga to read and thought that it was a good time to start reading this, and that was the worst decision of my life, i forced my way through 400 chapters of this manhwa and barely gets any enjoyment, everytime something promising happens, the author just start to ruin it like the way he did in the last season, by introducing \"new\" characters, telling \"new\" stories, that somehow just end up like the last season, everything leads to a big battle at the end and protagonist end up having to leave his friends behind to find a way to get stronger and somehow gets new friends in the process. Overall 4/10: main plot is barely developed even after 400 chapters, all the side plot are not intersting and the author just keep going in this pattern, art is somewhat bearable, characters are just bland and shallow even when a lot of the plot focus on their stories in stead of the main characters. I know that everyone have different tastes, but for me this manhwa is even less interesting than some isekai/ressurection manga/manhwa/manhua by some nameless authors that only have about 20 chapters overall, even those kind of stories have more plot than this.

It sucked. The premise was really good, with a tower that you have to climb and you have anything you want yada yada. It seems good, but it isn't. (minor to kinda important spoilers) It keeps you reading on and on, and people say it gets better on episode 500, (essentially chapter 500 on Webtoon). They're probably right, but getting through the torture of looking at such, (no offense), terrible art and anatomy, a horrible tedious story filled with filler, bland characters (not ... with common tropes sometimes, which i have to commend siu for), and the battle scenes although kinda good, are hideous compared to other Webtoons'. (sorry for that run-on sentence), I can't read it anymore. I just can't. The story doesn't progress from what i can see, and i waited at least 30 episodes from the announcement of the devil train, to even SEE the devil train by the protagonists. ALSO, I had to wait episodes, (a little less than 100 episodes), to see Rachel and Hazelnut, (im sorry i forgot his name), to even interact or be in PROXIMITY. tl;dr; tog seems good, and if you are fine with slow pacing, and spending days just trying to get to season 3 or minor plot points, or if you're just generally a saint, then it is good for you if you are a normal person, & don't have the time or patience just to read 500 episodes, then it is NOT for you"}, {"score": "9", "content": "I started reading this manhwa because I saw it was getting an anime adaptation. Before I watched it I wanted to give it a go on its original version (and it's the first time I happen to cross a manhwa adaptation in a japanese animation). So, well, the first season is perfect. Neverending suspense, touching characters once you come to know you're bound to, schemings behind hidden plots, a lot of humour and the right amount of action. I can't, however, bring myself to draw the 10/10 perfect score because of one thing, happening mostly in the second season I'm currently reading: it gives me headaches. Because ... it is confusing. Focusing on the suspense, the actions are chaining really quickly and that's great for the heart-pounding feeling. But, the backfire is that I can't process all the consequences of the informations provided and add them up to those I've gathered. So, for those who don't look more into it, everything's fine, but as I need to stop every 5 chapters to fathom what just happened, who's who, who betrayed, who joined, and why's that, and more importantly what does it implies for the coming next floor, I can't say it's perfect. Why did I give such a hign score though? Well, the story is very unique and as I can't bring myself to not read it every day since I started, it shows I'm hooked. I'm worried because I still have some spare chapters because I catch up to the latest release, and I'm already unable to sleep without brainstorming about the schemes and motives of all the characters. So prepare yourselves before you start reading it, because it won't release you until you've reached the end. But, you shouldn't miss such an opportunity.

Let me explain what this series is - it is about Boy called 25th Bam who has enterned to mysterious Tower. He has some purpose that forced him entenring there. In first or Second Chapter it was explained that when you enterned a Tower you have to climb on ... it's top where you can : - find any treaure - satisfy any need of yours - find something that transcendents those above It was said that through time in Tower was created a political system with King and Nobles. At moment of begining of series there is a Royal Family and 10 Great Families - those guys seem to keep rule in Tower. So you know something about Tower! Well let's talking about why ToG is empty and characters weren't fully used. That will include also Art of series. Our main Character - 25th Bam from begining was meeting those guys from 10 Great Families and even has met members of Royal Family. They even became his companions... What could go wrong? Author has focused on making Shounen from this Series. I mean there is way too much fights. Author created good universe (Tower) where he can add everything. And here those characters from 10Great Families can help to improve series - Explaining, talking more about the Tower, it's system, rules or whatever they were teached. And not only those guys from Nobility - every character can add something - rumors, own experience. After 10 years of publishing author keeps doing one thing - you won't know about something until that thing will be involved in MC's way. One thing was in Season 1, then it was more explained in late Season 2, and after that... still waits to be explained, Also fights are big problem - they're exist just to cover a website. On begining They're good but in Season2 there is one pattern : - drawning Character A in left up corner - drawning Character B in bottom right corner - they're shouting names of their attacks - then between them draw a white rays like those on Jesus' portrait or other Deathstar's laser or whatever to cover space between them. Only because that late chapters are long - few infomation about Tower/world/characters and tons of Lasers/holy rays. Art of characters - here you can see Authors evolution! While on begining it was not interesting in Season 2 it is absolutely Beautful!!! At now I'm confused - on the one hand we have got a tons of characters who can be developed and wait what will be done with them. Also same goes with world of Tower where still a lot of things have to be explained. On the other hand there's tons of unused characters and occasions. Lot of empty chapters and following overused schemes. However I was still enjoying - these series has given me what I like the most.

Indeed, the seemingly ordinary scenario turns out to be of a completely different kind because the main objective of climbing the Tower takes a step back (while remaining ubiquitous), to become a backdrop on which the true story unfolds. It is full of humor and ... rebound to the point that it manages to surprise the reader several times. The almost total lack of information given to the reader as to the characters, which could be taken first and foremost as a weakness, turns out to be on the contrary a great scripting force. Each climbs the Tower, without really knowing what it is and what it contains. The characters are very well developed and become very endearing because of their diverse personalities, forged by their past and determining their goal within the Tower.

The story may be a little hard to follow at first but be patient everything will be explained in time. One of the primary things that attracted me to tower of god was it’s amazing cast of female characters the majority of the primary female characters are bad ass unlike Sakura from naruto or Orihime from bleach they actually have value and can fight and have a personality. Overall this is probably most diverse cast characters I’ve read in awhile. Now the power system is ... like nen from hunter x hunter but a lot stronger the tog universe in terms of power scaling is way stronger than let’s say naruto one piece etcetera but not as Strong as dbz or toriko. The world building is truly Fantastic and has a great deal of mystery involved the only story that compares would probably be one piece and hunter x hunter. The artwork in the first season is average but becomes amazing in the next 2 seasons. Overall the people who dislike this series are people who are either too dumb to understand it or did not give it a chance. Be patient and you will love this story. The characters are amazing the world building is outstanding and again the female characters are by far the best I’ve seen in manga webtoons manhua you name it. The only cast of female characters that can compare would be claymore. When you read tog I also highly suggest reading the wiki for it will help you gain more insight into the tog universe. The only story that compares imo is hunter x hunter.

The number one issue this manwha has is the fact that the tower is way too fucking tall, and despite the fact that there is an ungodly amount of content to get through, the chapters are nonetheless paced like if something tied cement bricks to a sloth and then ... broke its kneecaps. I have only taken a glimpse at the newest chapters, and I imagine that if the story is to finish within -idk- like the next millennium or so, then it cannot continue at the pace it is currently going at. The number two issue is that the art is extremely homogenous; it's just panel after panel after panel of yellow, blue, green and red lightbeams, over and over and over again, in perpetuity. Like fuck me, how is there so little going on on screen? It's so monotenous. And all the backgrounds are the exact same flavor of uninteresting temples and floating islands, or alternatively a matrix of anime action lines and led colours. If someone put me in an interrogation room for a day, showed me random panels from this manwha, and told me I would be liquidated on the spot if I couldn't correctly identify which 10 chapter selection at least 50% of the panels were from, my brainmatter would undoubtedly be splattered on the walls come Monday, even if I were to read the entire manwha over again the week before. The third issue is that all the characters have paper-thin personalities. Baam is the most boring protagonist in any shonen-esque show I have ever seen or read. He has close to no personality besides mildly content and slightly disturbed. The whole point of shonen protagonists is that they're exciting, and that they make you want to root for them. Baam has got the whole overpowerdness of the male power fantasy down without any of the excitment to go along with it. Like what's the point? I don't remember why I stopped reading TOG, I think it just got super uninteresting to me at some point, and I realized that I was wasting my time.

Once upon a time this was my favorite story, and I still love it dearly, but I haven't been keeping up with TOG as of late. The reason is very simple, the story is too long, to the point where it's starting to get frustrating, and SIU (the author) keeps expanding the world by introducing new plot related questions and mysteries every new arc, while ignoring questions and mysteries that are over a decade old, since they were introduced in ... season 1, therefore in 2010. The reason why this frustrates me is that by keeping a lot of stuff a secret I don't feel like I'm getting rewarded for keeping up with the story, because I know that I won't get the answers to my questions anytime soon. Thus I'm stuck not even knowing basic background information for my favorite characters, which is honestly absurd. I understand keeping some of the background of the main character a secret, but nearly every single character in this story has a mysterious background that isn't expanded upon EVER! There's literally a single info-dump arc in the entire series, and it's not even a full arc but 2-3 chapters, with all the info being related to the main character. With all of that being said, I'm going to rate this 9/10 because of nostalgia. Not only nostalgia for TOG but nostalgia for making me feel like I'm watching Hunter x Hunter as a kid again. Objectively though, I think that if you turn off your brain, don't worry about theory crafting, and read TOG to see how a boy with a mysterious background gets stronger and fights opponents way above his league, with many of them being literally thousands of years old, you'll enjoy it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "ToG is legit one of the best graphic novel ever created.

However, as an avid reader and fan of the genre, I must express my disappointment with this series and its glaring flaw: the constant introduction of new characters at big events. You ... might think that introducing new characters would add depth and complexity to the story, but in Tower of God, it turned into a chaotic mess. With each major event, readers are exposed to a barrage of strange faces vying for attention and relevance. This constant influx of characters dilutes the narrative focus and makes it difficult to transfer emotion to any one of them. Rather than allowing existing characters to grow and develop, the narrative always revolves around these new additions, making established characters feel neglected and underdeveloped. It's frustrating to spend time and energy trying to connect with certain characters, only to find them fade into the background as the story unfolds in a confused ensemble of unknown faces. Additionally, the pacing of the story is disrupted by the introduction of this excessive number of new characters. Tower of God often suffers from information overload, requiring readers to absorb vast amounts of new information about each character's backstory, abilities, and motivations. The story loses momentum, bogged down in presentation, leaving little room for further development of the actual plot. The negative effects of this constant influx of characters are evident in the overall webtoon cohesion. Tower of God started with a promising premise and interesting worldbuilding, but has fallen into chaos that struggles to maintain a clear and compelling storyline. Too many characters hinder the author's ability to effectively develop the characters, and lack the reader's emotional engagement. In summary, Tower of God is disappointing due to the constant introduction of new characters at major events. This decision stunts character development, disrupts the pacing, and ultimately makes the series less interesting. As a reader, it's disappointing to see webtoon potential lost due to such obvious flaws"}, {"score": "8", "content": "Tower of God is one of the grandest, most ambitious, and engrossing comics I have ever read. However, it has many flaws that prevent it from being one of the greatest fantasy comics. First, let's focus on what the series is doing right. Tower of God has one of the most interesting and vast worlds I have seen in a fantasy story. The concept of a massive tower-like structure with each floor being a world is novel and damn cool. The way the world of the tower is introduced and set up is interesting as well. It is evident that the author put a lot ... of effort and passion in creating such an ambitious world. The titular Tower is full of mysteries and the societies present within it are engaging as well. The various politics and groups add up to make a world that feels alive in many ways. The many tests and trials the characters go through are also unique and fun. It reminds of Hunter x Hunter and One Piece in the way it's structured. The artwork starts rough, but over time it becomes quite good. The panel layout utilizes the scrolling of digital manwha well and the character designs are all very unique as well. Overall, it has an interesting world, lore, and presentation. However, I have many issues with this series. The characters can be quite lacking for example. Many have cool designs, origins, and abilities but tend to one note, forgettable, and undeveloped. It also does not help that there are so many characters. Even the protagonist, Baam, can be dull and bit uninteresting. The series also has immense power creep and anyone who is not a main character will have a hard time keeping up. My final critique is that the story does not utilize its interesting setting to its full potential. The many societies, races, and people of the tower tend to lose focus as the series goes on. Overall, Tower of God is an enjoyable and engaging series despite its shortcomings. It has a cool premise and setting but has issues in its character writing and worldbuilding.

It seems that the effect of the shounen writing has not fully done its harm and is still making the story worse and worse. A big problem is that the first season which was great overall and is supposed to act as the foundation ends up messing with the rest of the story that was written with a completely different writing style. This has basically become a shonen instead of ... a manhwa. The author has changed his plans because of criticism from fans and unfortunately does not always do what he had originally planned to do. Lots of the lore is still hidden and purposely hidden in a pretty dreadful way. Not much can be said about the story yet since there is still so much we don't know. The execution of plotlines has had it's up and downs but has been mostly okay so far in my opinion. The characters are pretty poor and one of the characters that is the fandom's most hated character is a protagonist of the story and actually the author's favorite character. There seems to be a lot of division on whether or not the main character Bam is a good character or not, but I would say he's weird overall. There is no romance and it seems that there never will be any significant romance. Character development seems horrible too especially with the fact that characters can live for centuries and does not appear to be getting any better, but actually worse. The story has amazing worldbuilding and the greatest worldbuilding I have seen so far in any series, even one piece. The story is at a strange place right now and it is hard to know for sure where it's going to go. If you dislike the story during season 2, it is probably best to drop the story since the beginning half is the best part so far.

Not even the best stories in the world are 10/10, and this does not meet those standards, anyway. The story has an interesting premise with Rachel leaving to climb a tower, and the main character, Bam, following after her. This plot point is fine for the start, but I found it takes too long for the character to get any other motive for climbing the tower. He is pretty much obsessed with this Rachel for about 90% of the chapters that I have read. I won't spoil it, but considering what happens ... earlier in the story, this should have been sorted out far earlier. The pacing was pretty poor for this point and resulted in a lull in the middle of the story, and turns Bam into a dislikeable idiot who will sacrifice anything and everything for quite some time. And yet his friends still stick with him, despite him preferring to continue chasing Rachel even if they all die. There is no reason for his friends to stick with him. There are some decent characters in the story, but some of them become tiring. One character (a giant lizard) keeps repeating the same joke for 500 chapters. It becomes pretty boring to read. His character has not actually changed since the beginning, and this is a problem for quite a few others. There is not enough development, and quite a lot of them feel like throwaway characters. Another character that they make quite a fuss of in the first season sort of disappears, but shows up very randomly. The main character, Bam, has ultimate plot armour. In fact there is a story device in it that explains his plot armour, which means you will never feel that he is ever threatened. Everything will always work out for him due to his powers continually adapting to save him from any situation. This limits the quality of the story and renders it into a power-growth fest. His plot armour is part of the lore. Pacing is a real issue with this story. There are some plot lines that have seen no development for 300 or so chapters. You would think the writer has maybe changed his mind about them and just brushed them under the carpet, but references appear every so often to these plotlines that show they are not dead. He still plans to do them, but it has been so long that I do not care about them anymore, nor the characters related to them. The art style starts off alright at the beginning, but it improves a lot later on. A massive improvement happens after season 1, so do not hold the art against this. It is one of the major reasons I have given this a 7. It makes it an enjoyable and semi-mindless read.

If this is the case, I have come to like it and on several occasions I reread the chapter that I wanted. The first time I read it it was addicting, although at first I wasn't too interested in reading it (I thought the story would ... be romantic because it featured Baam and Rachel in the header of the Webtoon when it was first released in my country, so in the end I only read the prologue and eps 1 out of curiosity too). Then when I intend to read all of them, it really makes me addicted, while looking for which part of the story is interesting, why people can like it, and so on. I continue to read it until now (season 3). Even though sometimes I feel bored like I said before, I still believe that in the future there will be more interesting things for the writer to tell.

The overall story is quite interesting but each arc usually boils down to some sort of over complicated tournament which just becomes so tedious and boring. The world that Tower of God is set in is quite an interesting concept- a giant tower with different floors where people have to pass challenges to go up, but this severely limits the story structure of each story arc in the above mentioned tournament. As well as this, a lot of the lore in ... ToG comes from the author's notes, which is quite frustrating as it feels like the author is too lazy to add in these plot points into the story (although they are not always that important but quite interesting nonetheless). Art [5/10]: The art is pretty bland. The quality itself is okay (apart from the first 50 or so chapters where it really is just low quality in my opinion) but I really dislike the art style; most panels are boring to look at especially in \"fights\" which have now become incoherent beams of light hitting each other. The art also makes the setting quite confusing, as it is sort of like a cross between a weird fantasy/sci-fi world with space ships at the same time as special soul stealing characters, and the art makes the environment quite ambiguous as to what t.one is trying to be set, although I'm sure some people may find this appealing Character [5/10]. Firstly, the character design is awful in Tower of God. This is more of the art style complain but I'll put it here anyway. A lot of the characters look very generic or just similar to one another and their clothing especially makes me wretch- people wearing Adidas tracksuits or just trousers in an (admittedly) epic world just is really off putting. Most of the characters themselves are either boring or under used. There are three main characters: Bam, although he used to be a very intriguing character in the second season, is now just so hard to read because of no personality beyond \" I like my friends and want to save them\". Khun is okay I guess but him and Rak are basically just comic relief characters now because they are too weak to keep up with Bam. I'm not going to bother mentioning any other characters because they probably won't be in it for another 100 chapters anyway as per. Enjoyment[6/10]: Although I have criticised the series a lot, I did moderately enjoy it, although this was more due to the mind-numbing amusement in Shonen fights and power ups more than anything else and the theories that come with a rich,mysterious world like the Tower. With that said, I will still continue reading Tower of God to the end due to how intriguing the story is but at the same time I eagerly await the conclusion that can't come quick enough. Overall: 7/10"}, {"score": "9", "content": "TOG is my favourite mahnwa and I recommend it a lot for people who want to enter the mahnwa world. 1st season is the prologue, 2nd season is where I see a lot of development off all characters. Sadly, 3rd season is prob the worst out of the 3 seasons. All the arcs seem pretty boring and there's a LOT of random characters. What happened to the characters they developed on 2nd season? The story is full of mystery, which and be a double sword, but overall I think the series will take a turn for the best and I'm hoping the 4th season ... will show the full potential of the series."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Tower of God is not your ordinary Shounen. SIU, the author, has stated he doesn't want to tie Tower of God down to a single genre. The story-line and lore is comparable to Naruto Shippunden, it definitely deserves more praise. I came from the anime, I watched it and loved it. There was quite a bit of content removed for the anime, some parts I wished weren't and some parts I agree with. How does a webtoon compare to normal manga,? the chapters (episodes) are longer. They're longer but are also not longer, the number of panels is similar to Shounen Jump manga but there is ... so much more text. A single chapter (episode) can give so much information, which is why ToG is so good for theory lovers like myself. It will take you longer to read than you first expect, I can read 100 manga chapters in a single day if I try. ToG has ~480 chapters yet it took me over a week to read completely. The art of Season 1 is good but not great, Season 2 starts with very good art and it only improves from there. There are times when it's a bit hard to tell what's going on in a panel but for the most part it is very very high quality art. Almost every single chapter (episode) has panels that are background worthy. The main critique of ToG is the numerous side arcs, there are a few side arcs that are quite lengthy. It gives me Hunter X Hunter vibes, if you like Hunter X Hunter then I think you'll love ToG. I do wish the story stayed more direct but I have always enjoyed every single arc, even if I started by hating the fact we had a side arc, I ended up very much enjoying the arc. The main issue is that we still know very little about FUG, Wolhaiksong, and the 10 Great family leaders. There are over 400 chapters, 07/29/20, so I wish we knew a lot more than has been revealed thus far. The characters are done well and almost every major character has some interesting backstory that we can't wait to be developed more. Bam, the main character, has had a lot of development throughout the series. There have been times where he's turned a bit dark or times when he's been too good. His main development comes from his views on saving people, to save everyone or be selective. It makes him a very interesting character. Other characters, like Rachel, are an enigma. Rachel's character keeps conflicting with itself, not in an uncontrolled way that would be the mark of a bad writer, but rather in a very interesting way that makes you question her actions. The power system is not easy to scale, it mostly comes down to who has the bigger and flashier attack. Despite this, our characters have made very clear and controlled progression throughout the series. Some are through training arcs and some are through emotion during fights, Bam also has a unique ability to copy almost any skill after seeing it once. The story is always layered, every single arc will have multiple plot twists and developments. It can be tedious if you want the story to progress but it is always thoroughly enjoyed. The arcs flow well too, they almost never pop out of nowhere. ToG is a story that will have you making theories for weeks, there is so much mystery in the series and it only layers more on. The entire world itself is fascinating, it definitely sets itself apart from other shounen. The lore is very expansive, there is so much we are yet to learn that could change everything we know. Currently, 07/29/20, ToG is on an indefinite hiatus due to the author's health. I wish SIU a speedy and full recovery."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Are you a fan of One Piece? Are you a big fan of manga that are set in a massive, sprawling world filled with a large variety and number of characters? Do you want an unforgiving world overflowing with treacheries, wars, and a battle to arrive at the top? A world where our main characters, puny and unproven, must embark on a journey to change the world? Then you’ve come to the right place, as we look into the Korean webtoon, Tower of God. Before we get into the thick of the review, I must set up the criteria I’m going to be ... using to analyze the webtoon. I like to judge graphic novels according to 3 primary components, those being plot, characters and finally, art. Off course, given the massive amount of content present within the webtoon, I will have pros and cons present within each of these components. First, we will start with the cons. Cons: 1) Plot: A few story arcs have slow setups and start to them. The plot doesn't pick up until the arc is halfway through, and this may be seen as boring for some people. Sometimes, the setup will feel like its dragging on until the plot picks up, and some corners could've been cut in these setups to improve the pacing of the story arcs. 2) Characters: Honestly, there isn’t much I can criticize over here. The webtoon’s strongest point is its large and diverse cast of characters. One minor criticism I have is the fact that the villains of the first few arcs of the webtoon lack the sufficient amount of characterization they needed; however, they very much make up for it with their charisma and menacing presence. But this problem is very soon resolved with a cast of well developed and interesting villains. 3) Art: The art in the first season of the webtoon is, to be blunt, not very good. The characters are drawn very roughly, with inconsistent linework, and there is a clear lack of depth in certain frames. The backgrounds are somewhat decent, credit where credit is due. The strongest aspect in season 1 has to be its panelling, while still not perfect; it helps the scenes play out seamlessly as you scroll down. Pros: 1) Plot: Although occasionally Tower of God may stumble in its setups to story arcs, once it gets going, and all the way to the climax and the end, it’s always a seamless ride, with clashing character motivations, political intrigue, and of course, climactic battles. It is especially mesmerizing how SIU can branch out sub-narratives within an arc, and always have them smoothly converge and combine in the finale, with almost nothing going to waste. The political intrigue of the tower is also fascinating and interest to watch, as different factions vying for power form and break alliances to achieve their distinctive goals. This ultimately leads me to the lore of the tower; as such a massive and expansive world has a history just as rich and captivating as you would expect it to be, with the history itself deeply rooted into conflicts that ultimately culminated in the challenges our protagonist and his allies face. Credits must be also given to the battle design of the webtoon. The concept of shinsu (Korean for ‘water of God’) is simple, neatly balanced in the middle of the scale between soft and hard magic systems. It has enough mysteries and intrigue behind it to give the readers a desire to know more, and it also has enough technicalities to make the battles interesting to follow. Add to that an interesting concept of battle positions and weapons based on fishing (e.g. Fishermen, Wave controllers, Light Bearers), and you have in your hands a well-balanced battle system that doesn't teeter too much on either side of the extremes. Another thing I have to mention is how the series deals with comedy. Normally, shounen battle manga will have downtime ‘comedy’ arcs, where in-between serious story arcs, a few chapters will be dedicated to a comedic lighthearted romp to cool down after a gruelling high stakes arc. But Tower of God seldom has those, instead opting for downtime arcs that offer more personal character reflections and conversations. Instead, the comedy is generously scattered across the webtoon, with small moments of reprieve and comedy in-between serious conflicts acting as a way for the readers to calm down and collect. What I like about this approach is that it allows the series to keep a consistent tone throughout, i.e. instead of dedicating chunks of the story to comedic arcs that introduce tonal shifts; it instead opts to sprinkle the comedy throughout the series, allowing for a more even and consistent tone. 2) Characters: The best part of Tower of God, undoubtedly, is its characters. The main cast all has well-defined motivations and distinct personalities. Development is also top-notch, with the characters developing both in terms of morality and capability. Both the protagonists and antagonists have clearly defined goals, and the decisions they make based on their objectives are also largely influenced by their past experiences and personality, adding a sense of continuity to the plot. The characters in the series follow a revolving door style of appearance usually seen in such epic and massive stories. Aside from a few mainstays, characters will come and go, with some leaving for hundreds of chapters on end before having a triumphant return in a story arc. But in the context and scale of the story, such a format is believable, as the characters will not always possess the same interests and goals as our mainstays, and may only return when their paths happen to converge. The protagonist’s side all possesses distinct personalities that seamlessly bounce off of each other and their camaraderie is fulfilling to watch. The series does a good job of balancing the allied characters in each story arc, giving them all moments to shine. The antagonists all have a level of moral intrigue to them, and they aren’t exactly complete black or white in terms of morals and actions, and even though you’ll usually find yourself in disagreement of their actions; looking from their perspective, you’ll come to understand and sometimes even sympathize with them. However, the star of the show definitely has to be the main protagonist of the series, Bam. Normally, shounen protagonists will start off with a distinct and boisterous personality that demands your attention, but in contrast to that, Bam starts as a blank slate. He lacks the charisma or the intrigue that is required in such a high energy series. Instead, the first season is carried by its side characters, especially the cunning and calculating Khun Aguero Agnes and the attractive and deadly Endorsi Jahad. But a blank slate is just that, an empty canvas the artist can freely draw on, and draw SIU does. Of course, any further delve into how this blank canvas is drawn on begets spoilers, and I'd like this to be spoiler-free. 3) Art: After a shaky start in the art department in season 1. The webtoon finds it footing with season 2, and by the time you're halfway through, it has improved to the point of some really well-detailed art. It brings in some jaw-dropping wide-angle shots; brimming with detail and character, as well as well pronounced action frames with meaty impacts that you can feel bursting off the screen and sending tremors down your body. Character designs are also very well done, with each character having a distinct silhouette, style and clothing. One of the thing that the webtoon does that sets itself apart from its shounen contemporaries is that most of the main cast has a very dynamic wardrobe, and with every new arc, you can expect most of the characters to go through some sort of outfit change. I find it very refreshing, especially in a medium where artists choose to have a very static wardrobe for their characters. Side note: In regards to the anime adaptation recently completing its adaptation of the first season of the webtoon (as of the writing of this review), I would still very much recommend that you instead read the webtoon from the start. The anime cuts out a lot of the smaller character interactions that make the series special for me, and it's also very crucial in developing said characters. But the anime does have its strong suits, especially the brilliant soundtrack done by Kevin Penkin, a stellar voice acting performance done by an all-star cast of voice actors, excellent art direction and good animation. So wrapping it up, I should instead recommend that you begin by reading the webtoon, and upon finishing season 1 of the webtoon, watch the anime up to season 1, make your conclusions, and then jump back into the webtoon with season 2 (this is optional and you can just skip the anime entirely if you are tied for time). However, later seasons of the anime may be released and depending on their overall quality in comparison to the webtoon, you may instead choose to watch the anime and not be wrong in doing so. But even so, I’ll still recommend that you read the webtoon to get the full experience. In conclusion: Tower of God is an epic, tower spanning adventure filled with mysteries and battles; where a rich world and political landscape acts as a backdrop for a colourful yet complex cast of characters, and a larger-than-life clash of morals and goals. Anybody who is a fan of battle shounen or shounen for that matter needs to make it their top priority to check this one out. To top it all off, all of it, from the start to the current, still ongoing chapters as of the writing of this review (which all currently adds up to 484 chapters!), is available for free on Webtoon, completely legal and available on their mobile-friendly app. So I don’t see any excuses for waiting on this one. With a solid 10/10 on plot, 10/10 on characters, and 9/10 on art, this is a must-read 10/10 for me."}, {"score": "7", "content": "Look i have read a big part of this manwha and i do love the originility when it comes to kind of the power system and secrets. But there are many parts in the story that feel kind of forced and lack structure. For example the fact that everyone starts as an e or d rank regular but they already fight or have to confront powers from the tower itself that rankers cant even defeat makes little to no sense to me. Its as if the rank system wouldnt matter at all. On top of that around the chapter 200 or something the artstyle and ... quality of the mawha dropped immensly. It looked like a kids drawing with flat colors on many occasions. The anime did a great job showing off the quality such a story deserves so im waiting for the second season. And one of my biggest complaints when it comes to the story would be the conflict with rachel. Without revealing too much im just gonna say that it drags out way too much in the story and it feels repetitive at some point. Its as if the writer wants to keep her to have bam following a goal but that aspect could have been solved looooong ago."}, {"score": "10", "content": "\"This is perfect\" here i said in my room at the night while reading tower of god, trully this series is the gift that keeps on giving, when i heard about this series receiving an anime i knew it was apparently a korean manga that only gets good on season 2, i had low expectations, but oh boy it's so much more then that, it's hard to put into words how much i enjoyed reading this and still do, but i'll give my best, STORY: The story of Tower of God is fantastic, ever since one piece i haven't witnessed such a enormous universe with so ... many mysteries to be unraveled by the most charismatic group of characters ever, it starts pretty dumb with a boy going after a girl, but that's just the tip of the iceberg, a giant iceberg, we have a tower and anyone who gets to the top basically becomes god, with the journey to get there being basically impossible for average ppl, then comes our protagonist Bam, at first he looks quite average, but slowly and slowly we get the hints to his hidden power, and potential to bring a storm of fury towards the tower, at first i didn't like him that much, but his development is quite interesting but i'll leave that to later on, the cenary in TOG is amazing as each floor differs from each other and as higher and higher the characters go more crazy/stronger and the stakes of fights/tests of the floors just keep getting more insane, yet what makes this story so intriguing are the most important factors of why the tower so mysterious and dangerous in the first place: the concept of \"irregulars\" and \"regulars\" and the 10 great families, the king zahard, zahard princesses, FUG and the slayers, Rankers, High Rankers and Guides, and the power system of Shinsoo and the different classes, each new revelation about all of this and more is what kept me reading this nonstop even after 400 chapters, the way i see the progression in the story of TOG is very simple, it's like you're climbing the tower yourself, and reading it is like riding an elevator, just a very slow one, and with all the twists and turns possibles, sometimes it stops for a while, then ur certain it's gonna fall or blow up, u just never know what's about to happen and that's what makes reading tower of god such a thrilling experience. CHARACTERS: Best setting of characters ever, i don't even know in what SIU is more of a genius, the creation of the story or the characters, actually is the fusion of both is what makes this a masterpiece, Bam is not the perfect protagonist, u may think he is just a simp but he probably had so much more development then any shounen protagonist out there, even his relation with rachel is good for the story imo, he's just simply perfect for the tower, and i don't mean for us readers but for the tower world itself, it may sound cliche, but the supporting cast provides so much that this it becomes irrelevant, Khun is one of the most badass and smart dudes ever, his strategies and schemes are always a pleasure to see, also his friendship with bam is beautiful, but none of that would be possible without the best alligator EVER, Rak Wraithraiser, honestly he is so badass and cool and funny, i really have no words to describe how hilarious he is, and despite that still has one of the biggest hearts among all characters and his viewing of friendship and the tower is also necessary for bam's group to advance in many ocasions, but my ultimate favorite character is Hwaryun, when i got the concept of guides and the objectives of Hwaryun towards bam she became the best character for me instantly, other great characters to me: Kallavan, White/Hoaqin, Wangnan, Yuri Zahard, Androssi, Baylord Yama, Karaka, Yeon Yihwa, Khun Ran, if i were to talk about all of them i would be here all night so let's keep it at that... but there's 1 character i'll just mention briefly here... Rachel, well she's one of the most hated characters in the entire world and i have wished her to die multiple times while reading it, but sadly we must admit, her being a bitch makes the story good sometimes, but still if SIU doesn't have something (bad) major prepared for her later on, it will cause massive outrage from the fanbase ART: So i will use the art part to talk about the fights, the fights in season 2/3 are simply INCREDIBLE, the reason i gave 9 to the art is because is bad in season 1, but u would hardly believe it's the same guy drawing when u see the superb quality of late season2 and season 3, Shinsoo is the coolest power system ever in my opinion, we get a variety of powers and fight styles from the all the characters, that just gets better and better as the strongest ones start to apear, and that would never be as good without SIU amazing improvement on art, just looking at the way he draws powers/monsters/stylish guys on his prime is a joy to myself, so basically that's the deal with the art if it was as good as it is today in the beginning of the series... god knows how many more people would be reading this Anyways, tower of god is a manhwa masterpiece much better then many manga out there, with the coolest characters i ever saw in my life"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Sup, turtles! ToG is the answer to the very important question \"what if Hunter x Hunter and One Piece had a baby, then stabbed the baby and each other in the back for mysterious reasons?\". If you need more reasons to read it (I think I got it all covered already), I'll get in a bit more detail with NO SPOILERS. Story: 9/10 Do you like Hunter x Hunter and One Piece? What about a series that combines the best aspects of both? The first season is pretty much one big homage to the Hunter Exam arc, with the main plot device being our main cast going ... through a series of life-risking tests, most of them very entertaining to watch. The tests are well made and become a staple throughout the series, though they start getting less frequent as the series starts expanding its incredibly detailed world and all its underlying themes. The Tower is absolutely MASSIVE. I have not seen this rich level of detail in world building since One Piece, hence the constant comparison. SIU went to great efforts in order to make the world of ToG feel alive, full of mysteries and events that affect the world without direct relation to the main cast, with many different factions fighting each other to achieve their own specific goals. The floors are for the most part very unique, basically their own pocket worlds with different rules and plotlines (very much like the islands in One Piece). The series is worth reading for the world lore alone, but there is so much more. MYSTERIES. This world and its characters are so full of interesting mysteries its hard to choose what you wanna find out the most first. The way some of its mysteries end up being revealed can be a bit lackluster at times (looking at you, Garan \"Exposition\" Jarad), but there is always something being hinted at or foreshadowed which will make you keep reading because you don't need sleep, you need ANSWERS! What are you willing to do in order to fulfill your dreams? Do the ends justify the means? These questions are at the center of nearly every character interaction in ToG. Unexpected alliances and shocking betrayals are so common the community gave ToG the lame but fitting nickname \"Tower of Betrayal\", you never know when a newly introduced character is being honest or hiding their true intentions, which keeps you at the edge of your seat most of the time. The battles go back and forth between cunning tactical skirmishes (usually led by best boi Khun) and over-the-top DBZ power clashing fights, so theres enough here to please all shounen audiences. Art: 6/10 This is a webtoon, so dont expect the art to have manga levels of quality. The first 50 chapters are barely good enough to be called professional, but the author improves A LOT over the course of the series, to the point where its actually very good now, for webtoon standards at least. Character: 10/10 ToG has a huge cast of entertaining, relatable characters, but here I will focus on its most unique aspect, the two protagonists. Bam is the amalgamation of every possible cliche a shounen MC could have: a classic Gary Stu, the Chosen One blessed by fate with the power of Asspulling, whose only motivation is to get stronger for the sake of protecting the people he loves, something we've seen a million times already. But dont let his lameness deceive you, IT IS INTENTIONAL. The author made Bam as cliche as possible to constrast him with one of the best written characters i've seen in recent years: the anti-hero MC, Rachel. Rachel is the true star of the series, the ultimate antithesis to everything Bam represents: she's weak, self-pitying, envious, manipulative and capable of doing anything to get what she wants, someone you could hardly believe to be a shounen MC. You feel a surge of hatred everytime she appears, so much that the hatred for her is what binds the entire ToG community together lol. People hate Rachel because she is far from being what an ideal MC should strive to be while still being extremely relatable, and relating so much to such a hateful character scares most viewers. She's an ordinary person struggling to become the heroine of the story despite not being chosen by fate like Bam, refusing to accept the fact there is nothing special about her and willing to do anything to fulfill her dreams despite of that. She is you, the viewer, isekaied into an over-the-top shounen battle world with nothing but your average wits to rely on, determined to leave your mark in history despite not being favored by fate. Fighting against fate with everything you have despite knowing there's very little chance you can win is the human condition in a nutshell, and that is what elevates Rachel to the level of outstanding fictional characters like Guts and Spike Spiegel: she feels like a real human being. This clash of Idealism x Reality, Destiny x Human Spirit represented by Bam and Rachel is the driving force behind ToG, and the author is slowly blurring this constrast with Bam starting to make cold hearted decisions, because in ToG, the MCs cant force the people they defeat into accepting their ideals (REVOLUTIONARY, I KNOW!), a clear sign of maturity and development to his one-note character, so you can expect these themes to get even deeper as the story goes on. Overall: 9/10 ToG is a masterpiece in the making. It has nearly One Piece levels of world building, outstanding character designs, epic fight scenes and plenty of interesting mysteries to hook you in. The only reason this series has remained unknown for so long is its manhwa webtoon origins, a very new medium that is only starting to get mainstream attention, hopefully the anime adaptation will give this series the praise it deserves.

So many aspects of it are good, the world, for one, is one of the most interesting and detailed I've ever seen, every floor and culture feels unique and the world-building of ToG is really similar to One Piece in a lot of aspects. The fights are also pretty good, the art isn't amazing or anything but a lot of the fights in season 1 and early season 2 are actually pretty great, striking a nice balance between strategy and action. ToG also has some of the best side cast I've ever seen. From ... Gwangnam and his crew, to Urek, to villains like Hell Joe. The plot for at leas until the Floor of Death arc are really good, and certain scenes like Urek's whole fish analogy with Hell Joe were excellent. Now you might've noticed a trend, in that everything I've praised so far doesn't relate to the main characters. That is for a very simple reason and that is because they are bad. I fucking hate Bam, he is actually one of the most boring fucking characters to ever exist and every scene he is in is just dragged down by him. He is literally just a vehicle for fights, and that'd be fine if his friends (Khun and the raptor guy) weren't also boring and one-note. None of them are interesting, they feel like the main cast in a first draft of the story. Their characters from at least where I'm at feel incomplete and as if, despite the fact they are literally the main characters, are being shoved into the story for no reason. ToG was at its peak in early season two when Bam barley existed and Gwangnam and his crew were the main characters. Gwangnam already has a more compelling character and motivation than Bam and his story even intertwines with the themes of rebellion that Bam's do, hell maybe even more than his. But no, the author sidelines all the interesting characters and just stuffs us with more useless fucking side characters and more time with the boring as hell main cast. What makes me the angriest about ToG is not that its bad, its that it comes so close so often to being amazing, and sometimes even is, but constantly stumbles over itself with boring side characters and somehow even less-interesting main characters. Overall I'd say ToG is maybe worth reading just for the lore and the occasional excellent moments, but for most people I think its better if you just watch lore videos on it or wait for the anime to adapt it, as they'll probably cut a lot of the useless time-wasting filler we get in the manwha."}, {"score": "6", "content": "Tower of God was actually a great series at first. However, as the episodes progressed and the arcs continued, it got lost in the universe it created. The story flows so slowly and the plot drags on so much that I can't explain. This is the first time in my life that I've witnessed a series get so lost in itself. Actually, everything was great until the Train arc. It was great especially until the part where Baam got separated from the main team and got back together with them. For the first time, something started to go wrong in that train arc. It was still ... very good, but the sounds of a fall echoed. Then each arc got worse than the other. However, none of them were like this until the arc with the cats and dogs. The main problems of the series are: - The universe is very large and every time new information is revealed, it gets diluted much more. Too many questions and too few answers. You constantly encounter new information and it either doesn't contribute to the main story at all or it contributes very little. Just mystery, mystery and more mystery. No answers. - There are too many characters. Instead of focusing on the main cast, hundreds of new characters are introduced and focused on them. We even find ourselves telling the past of an unimportant side character who seems to be only in one battle, for at least one episode. - The main cast is not processed. The main villains and main heroes are often pushed to the background. Even Baam, who plays a role in the main story, did not play as much a role as Yama and the others in this cat and dog arc. There is no need for so many unnecessary characters. - The information in the lore becomes unimportant. To summarize, Tower of God was really good when it tried to keep things as minimalist as possible. In fact, 5 classes are introduced and these classes are not bad at first, but as the story progresses, even this class system does not matter. Only the stronger one wins. Baam first seems like he will lose, then he gets a power up, then support comes, then he gets even stronger, and the same situation is repeated dozens of times in the following episodes with the same logic. The situation is the same or worse for the other characters. I want a neat story now. Since we moved on to this cat and dog arc, the story of the series has stopped progressing. It keeps getting sidetracked and I can't stand reading anymore. The series with the worst pacing I've ever seen is Tower of God. The interesting thing is that the arc where Baam got separated from the main group was incredibly good and the pacing was great. As I said, everything started from that train arc. I wish the mangaka would reboot the series from that train arc so that we could watch a more organized and uncluttered arc. I don't want to see hundreds of unnecessary characters and plots, I want to see the main cast and main enemies. Until then, I'm leaving Tower of God. Maybe if this series gets better one day, I'll start over, but I don't think it will get better anymore."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Tower of god is a story about a boy named 25th bam (or night) and his goal to chase after his friend rachel who decided to climb the tower of god.

Story: 10/10 The story itself is really interesting and, if you are like me, will have you looking to the wiki simply out of curiosity. (I highly recommend you do not visit the wiki until you are up to ... the latest chapter, as it is very easy to accidentally read spoilers. However once you do catch up, you should because apparently there is a fair bit more information revealed through the author's blog and if you are genuinely interested in the story, setting and world building then you will like it.) The story is told in a way where we receive about as much info about the world as the mc, where there isn't any random info dump where a character will start rambling on unprompted. Some might not like it since you don't get the answers to your questions right away. Some one else said that it seemed like the author was making stuff up in an as-you-go style, but it doesn't feel that way to me at least. The world of tower of god is so massive and there is so much going. Each floor is basically a world of it's own but it never seems like there is too much going on for it to work together. Idk if this would fit into a setting category but there isn't one so I am just gonna put it here. Art: 9/10 I say 9 solely because of the, um, rough art in the earlier chapters. Trust me, it gets a lot better. In fact just recently, in chapter 480 and the fight looks amazing. It probably won't hurt to have a look if you are a beginner cause the events are so far away that its basically not even spoilers. Characters: 10/10 Pretty much all the characters make sense and have pretty valid reasons for doing what they are doing. I say pretty much cause there is just 1 that I don't think anyone understands and you'll know who i mean when you start reading. The character development is really something, especially the development for bam. It is really enjoyable to have a character develop so much. He is still the sort of \"I must save everyone\" shounen mc but he in every other aspect he develops so so much and he is still developing. He literally changes in the latest chapter. Enjoyment: 9/10 I put it at 9/10 cause I did have to somewhat grind through the start. It was certainly interesting at the start, but bam being way weaker than everyone + the art + the overcomplicated games made me pause and come back a few times. But I have definitely binged the last 250 chapters at least. Most of the overcomplicated games have stopped. This means that the fights are more similar to other shounen fights of just punching your opponent harder but it is still quite enjoyable. I just wish khun would use his brains again cause he hasn't done anything particularly cool in a while, mainly just relying on his latest power up. The chapter length is also really good, with chapters being significantly longer than other series (or webtoons at least). Unordinary is another webtoon (that is also really good) and it can take less than a minute to get through a chapter whereas tower of god will take a few minutes to get through at least. This means you have a lot to binge through and I personally enjoy bingeing it more than waiting on a week to week basis. Overall: 10/10 If you average it out, it would be 9.5 but even though there are 9s in there, tog is definitely a 10."}, {"score": "7", "content": "For me plot comes first then the art. The idea of climbing to the top of the tower is not really common back when this was first released. Doing something bizzar for a girl? Not really surprising. However, there are these little plot twists that make your eyebrows raise and continue reading. Im honestly reading so i can watch the main character SNAP. Just like the tower, there are so many levels of twist in this story that just want you to climb up the tower with the main character in hope to find some answers. I LOVE how there are powerful women in this story ... AND how important they are in the plot. The type of art style isn't really my type (ITS NOT BAD) but MAN the plot its good."}, {"score": "7", "content": "I am amazed by the complexity of this story. I love how the author create a whole new world with its own rules and challenges on each floor. Each floor are uniquely different from one another.The artsyles at first are not the best i see but it gradually improved. The conversation is not overwhelming. It's very simple, direct and easy to understand. The story is however heavily focused on fight scenes. You might feel suffocated from reading the never ending fight on each floor. The pacing for this story is slow in the beginning but once the ''plot'' kicks in, boi it kicks you hard. Each side ... characters equiped with their own background stories with their own purpose and not just exist there as ''extra''. The main character is however quite the opposite.He has no background story, no bursting personality but as the plot moving, he developed from 1D character to a character with his own sense of feelings just makes me proud. It's an entertaining manhwa. You wont regret reading it."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Tower of God, despite it's flaws, is one hell of a ride and a very well written show that can appeal to all sorts of audiences. It's no masterpiece by any means, but it's a thrilling piece that won't fail to excite you, no matter which arc you're on. With the introduction out, I want to get the negatives out of the way aswell so I can focus on the positives. Also, since this is my review, not everything here will be objective. Let's start, my first bone to pick with this comic is the fact that it so heavily relies on plot armour and ... just the willpower of a character, compare the amount of times Bam got an upgrade from his willpower to how many times he actually trained for it. The second thing I heavily dislike is how it shows the backstory of a character before disposing off of them, it's kind of infuriating, although it does work well in some cases. The third biggest problem in the show is it's pacing, it's inconsistent, but more often than not, it's pretty slow most of the time which sometimes makes the could-be entertaining things somewhat uninteresting. The fourth thing that I don't like is the constant usage of new characters, instead of using the old ones, or better yet, developing the existing ones (although this does happen sometimes). I won't say I hate this, but it's certainly not something that I would like to see. With the negatives out, I now want to focus on the main part of this review, and those are the things I love about this comic. I won't go as far to say the side characters are bland, but a lot of them are not the most amusing bunch (although there are exceptions). But Bam manages to make each one of them, including himself shine. His chemistry with every character is really fun to see, specially with Khun. He himself is a very well written character though, I can't get into the details but his character development is absolutely phenomenally written, his ever-changing personality, the emotions that build up into him after each event, I could continue but this review would become only about Baam, so i'll move on to the next point. The plot, does this even need further explaining? Each arc is full of amazing action, mysteries, character dynamics and so much more that i'm surprised the author of this comic manages to pack it all in one compact comic. The build up to each mystery and their explanations are beautifully satisfying, the action keeps me hooked onto the comic and seeing each character interact with each other is one of the most entertaining things in this show. The plot overall seems very well thought out, with a lot of things behind it having logical reasonings that match up with everything shown so far. The world building of this show stands out particularly, as each mystery unfolds, it puts on another layer of complexity onto the tower, we're halfway through the series and the tower is already full of depth. It feels like an ever growing world, and everything the world entails makes sense for it to be there. That is much as I can say without spoiling, so if u want to get a taste of this you need to read it. There are many enjoyable characters in this comic that are very enjoying to watch. I know before I said I didn't exactly like the characters that this comic has, but this comic has such a huge arsenal of characters that it's hard to say you don't atleast like a few of them. It's a different approach to what other stories do, and I can't say I love this approach, but it is still an interesting one. Specially how so many of the characters that I thought were disposable, actually ended up having another layer to them. Other things that I love about the show are the power systems, and the way everything is used. Shinsu is such a simple yet complex system, it's fascinating how it's used differently by every different character. The team positions are set brilliantly considering how the world is, the author definitely put a lot of thought into this. The somewhat serious narration of this comic is something I love to, it feels extremely coherent to the world that it's set in. The comic doesn't make everybody look morally good, not even the MC, it shows what wrong the MC does, and it shows how other people are impacted by the MC's and other people's decision, it's great and refreshing to see this. The way the comic shows different perspectives is just another example of how much detail the author has put into this comic. The surface-level politics, similar to Attack on Titan, in this comic are something to keep an eye for too. Aside from the story, I love the unique artstyle of the comic it may not have the best art but it has improved a lot and it's definitely sufficient with the current quality. I've tried to make this a fair review, with as little bias as much possible. For some people, the cons may outweigh the pros, but for me even the little good things in this show measure so highly that the cons don't majorly affect my enjoyment. Certainly a good comic to read."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Manhwa that actually make me sit down and read for hours a day, the author really know how to make you interested in the world that he create, the storytelling is also really good, it give you piece by piece info about history of the tower, putting you in the same position as the mc which is just a clueless boy that doesnt know who he is, and what hes goal, he may feel like a simp in s1 but its justyfable because the girl is like a mother figure to him, and the first people that he talk to, but later on hes gonna ... grow up, the power scalling is also really good, like if the mc is facing a clearly stronger opponent he gonna get help from other people, and his power boost is also make sense, doesnt feel forced"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Eu posso ter dado muitas notas altas, mas esse é o meu Manhwa/Webtoon preferido.

A adaptação da 1ª temporada do anime não me agradou muito, ela ficou muito corrida e com alterações absolutamente desnecessárias (Principalmente o último episódio), espero que numa eventual 2ª temporada a Crunchyroll valorize e veja realmente o potencial que essa obra tem de ser um dos grandes, e dê a ela uma adaptação ótima e digna, uma adaptação merecida.

I do not remember who said it, but the person who said that Tower of God is the Corean One piece was completely right. (Warning: It may contain spoilers) Story: 10 The story of ToG is set inside a continental tower, a place where a single floor may be the size of a country; and in order to climb the tower, it is necessary to clear the tests of each floor. Betraying, trust, ideals, and change are the main topics inside the story with several plot twists that can, and will, blew up your mind. Characters: 10 All the characters are unique and ... original, it will be impossible to not feel attached to the main trio and supporting cast. We are going to find people hailing from important families, girls with horns or tails, giant crocodiles, swordsmen, cyborgs, magicians, demons, and a lot more, all with their struggles and backgrounds that are explained throughout the story. Art: 10 I am not going to sugarcoat anything, the art of the first past is horrible. If you decide to read it, you will see Sid from Ice age, no jokes. As the story progresses, starting more or less in part 2, the author's improvement is amazing and impossible to deny. Overall: Tower of God is such a compelling story with many new and fresh ideas that can reach everyone.

You can get anything you want if you manage to climb to the top of the tower. Even become a god. Hence, the name. That description itself is already more revealing than the one on webtoon and anymore would probably be spoilers. Story: 10/10 The story itself is massively interesting and, if you are like me, will have you looking to the wiki simply out of curiosity. (I highly recommend you do not visit the wiki until you ... are up to the latest chapter, as it is very easy to accidentally read spoilers. However once you do catch up, you should because apparently there is a fair bit of information revealed through the author's blog and if you are genuinely interested in the story, setting and world building then you will need to read it.) The story is told in a way where we receive about as much info about the world as the mc, where there isn't any random info dump where a character will start rambling on unprompted. Some might not like it since you don't get the answers to your questions right away. Some one else said that it seemed like the author was making stuff up in an as-you-go style, but it doesn't feel that way to me at least. The world of tower of god is so massive and there is so much going. Each floor is basically a world of it's own but it never seems like there is too much going on for it to work together. Idk if this would fit into a setting category but there isn't one so I am just gonna put it here. Art: 9/10 I say 9 solely because of the rough art in the earlier chapters.

The only thing that really keeps you interested is the tower itself and the mystery around it. There was a lot of potential in the premise, it could've been done wonderfully. Sadly, not all things turn out as you wish. The first season of the Manwha was very good, it seemed to have delivered with a good plot, well-done characters while still keeping intact the mystery. The first half of the second season was a mess, absolutely horrendous. I could barely ... get through 30 chapters before quitting for a week. I am not going to spoil much but the first half decided to introduce a completely brand new set of characters who were all thinner than a piece of paper, it was insane how much of a turn the entire plot took and that's in a bad way. Not to mention the cheesy dialogue and the new edgier bam didn't add much either. Anyhow, after a week of asking around to when it actually got good, I finally got an arc. It was the \"Workshop Arc\" that was directly after the horrible stuff. I decided to continue on and finally got to it. Surprise, the story had another major issue now. It was paced way too slow, literally reading through the chapters started becoming a chore. It was all just so uninteresting and I genuinely couldn't care less. It was like a filler arc, but somehow worse. The plot was a bit better but it really didn't matter. As I kept on reading, it became way too apparent that the show wasn't going to get better, even if it was, I am not going to read through another 200 chapters of absolute garbage to get to it. The story seems to have gone from the bizarre nature of the tower to how many useless side characters we can add in one plotline. It was way too obvious that SIU was trying to compensate for his lack of ideas and answers by adding more and more characters to show some sort of meaningless \"depth\" in his one-dimensional story. I gave this Manwha way too many chances, even read through visceral trash, and after 200+ chapters, I think I can finally make a judgment of it. Don't get me wrong, it's am not giving up on it just yet. I might just keep reading extremely slowly. Maybe even forget about it in a while, but if it all actually ever gets good. I'll update this score to an 8, no matter how much better. If a show takes 400 Chapters to get better, it isn't worth it. If you're someone who rightly expects a story to be good within its first 200 chapters, then ignore this Webtoon at all costs, but if you can handle painstaking going through bad chapters, 100s at a time then you might just find something at the end of the tunnel.

Since the first chapter, I've been hooked, it's story continued to keep me obsessed for so many chapters. The characters feel like they actually grow over time. The mc is a well-built character who isn't some crazy op guy right off the bat, but he gets there. There are a lot of interesting arcs and fights that are played out so well, and I think the absolute strongest part about this manhwa is the world-building. The world-building is so good, the author did a great job of making me actually want to learn more ... about the world, which is always an issue for me with certain manga, manhwa, and light novels. But to move on to my actual favorite part of this manwha, the art. Something about how you can see an artist's skill grow over time through a really interesting story just makes that art feel so much special.

The art gets somewhat better, and the side characters get progressively more interesting. But oh my god do the 3 main characters suck hard. Rak is an annoying cliché of animal side ... kick and Bam is given more power throughout the story for a reason that is explained far too late. Khun is ok I guess. The entire story feels like it looked at other anime/manga and went \"what was cool?\" and just threw it in. Its got a tournament arc, black edgy villains, and big fights where you can never tell what is going on. Its a mashup of stuff that looks great on the surface but not much else. Every problem is written off with the MC being \"irregular\" so he can do whatever the plot needs or a guide, someone who can see the future, telling the cast where to go.

Each character has their own vibe and backstory that makes you feel for them. You’ve got your heroes, your anti-heroes, and some folks who are just plain shady. The friendships and rivalries are super relatable, and you can’t help but ... get invested in their journeys. It’s like watching a rollercoaster of emotions unfold! And can we talk about the art? It’s fire! The style is unique, and the action scenes are so well-done that you’ll be on the edge of your seat. The backgrounds are detailed, and the character designs are just dope. Every panel is a feast for the eyes, and you’ll find yourself scrolling through just to soak it all in. The pacing is spot on too. It’s got that perfect mix of heart-pounding action and those chill moments where you get to know the characters better. And the plot twists? Man, they hit you outta nowhere! Just when you think you’ve got it figured out, bam—something crazy happens, and you’re left like, “What just went down?!” The themes in Tower of God are deep, too. It dives into power, sacrifice, and what it really means to be human. It’s not just a story; it’s a whole vibe that sticks with you long after you finish reading.

The combat system ... itself, which I thought would be based on the roles established in the first season, which were interesting, has been absolutely destroyed, and the fight is based on who has more strength than on what role they have and how they use their skills, the fight itself seems to be based on the level of power as in dragon ball rather than any tactics that I expected after the first season.Another problem I had are characters,there are soo many unlikable or indifferent characters and bam didin`t gat any visible character progression, he just painful to watch. first season 7-8/10 second season(1-251 chapters) 4/10"}, {"score": "8", "content": "I basically read all the chapters in 2 weeks of almost just reading all day in vacation, and I was pretty hooked throughout all of it thanks to the anime.

The characters and world building; the world is pretty darn extensive, with very rich lore with accompanying characters that complement it well, with alot of history behind them, the cast is pretty amicable, with interesting designs and backstories. I: The first volume consists of the Mc trying to pass a test to be able to climb the tower, I must say that the most interesting part was seeing ... how the art evolved through each chapter, since, when the author started, he was a complete beginner and got better drawing. II: [This is where the anime ends] The second volume shows us alot of worldbuilding which is pretty slick and dandy, only problem is that the author thinks we're pretty dumb, and tries to sneak a pretty obvious plot twist on us, the main flaw to this is that... if you have two pair of eyes, you can figure it out, in a heartbeat, and it takes a while to get things going. When the story starts gaining steam, it's pretty fun, and the art sometimes rivals or flexes on manga art, making you seriously imagine a reality where manga was all colored, but then... the longest drawn out arc \"Hell Train\" pops out and stops everything, lasting half of all the story, for me this is the most sluggish part and probably worst arc of tower of god, the train limits the main cast of characters, to be stuck in place, sometimes going to interesting spaces, but it gets old fast, until it finally ends. III: The third volume is mostly about fighting and getting off that train arc, this is where tower of god truly shines, we finally get answers to some of the long standing mysteries, and bunch of new cool characters, specially the best waifu, dunno why I forgot her name, but she's amazing.

The reason why I put the spoiler tag was because I didn't want people who didn't reach that chapter to know there is something big in there, but also for those who want to know the Lore drop was about who are Baam's parents. Also if I have to write it in a proper review format then I guess I have to add what is already implied: I love the little bit of gore in this show and seeing how that slowly changes Baam from the naive boy who grew up in a cave and lost his memories to a badass that a few chapters ago threatened Karaka, a High Ranker fug Slayer. Ever since he let himself get eaten by that Eel in the first episode I know there was something special about this MC, something that people may be quick to dismiss. He's the best depiction in anime of the 'chosen one' type of MC.

The events become very illogical (or, at least, exponentially more so) and almost all characters just revert back to their original selves, which made me feel like I just wasted a lot of time with no progression. The pacing slows down, too, which doesn’t help. A lot of set up with very little pay off.

I read the entire first season in less than a day and in just 3 days I've already read 250 chapters. For the first time in my life, I find myself completely addicted to a webtoon/manga and fight with the tiredness to keep and read another chapter. Art: It’s the first time I read a webtoon and it shook me. At first, the art wasn’t that great, and I thought it’s fine since the coloring covers up for it. Also, I believed that it’s kind of ok for the artist to put less effort in the ... accuracy since it’s a webtoon and the story is more important. I didn’t believe he was that professional. But he put me wrong, as the chapters continue the art just kept getting better, at some point, I just wished somebody will read it to me and it already feels like an anime to me. Story: From the very beginning we are thrown into a world with a LOT of questions about it, little by little we learn new things but just when we think we know it all, they manage to add another piece that fits perfectly to this world. The characters are amazing and their development and side stories are exactly what I like in any anime/manga/book/series I watch/read. I really enjoy and I really recommend to whoever watched or even didn’t watch the anime first season, start read and enter the wonderful world of “Tower of God”"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Art Art is a bit bad at Season 1, but improved greatly at Season 2 but somehow the transision or minor things in Season 3 decrease its quality.. maybe because every Author only have 1 week of deadline so that's why I guess the art decrease it's quality although not drastic.. Somehow atmosphere in Tower of God is lacking a soul. I don't know but it feels gloomy to me, the setting is fantasy world but the world is lacking any world building details. For example like all the place we see, we only have empty ally, empty hallways, empty open space, empty sky, even inside airspace ... its empty without tech and furnitures. I heard by fans this webtoon has a strong point in World Building, but I don't see any good points from it. Compared to another webtoons or some mangas they have detailed drawing so the places looks really alive and lifely. Character MC I have a mixed feeling about Bam as a main character, I'm actually pretty fine at first in Season 1 and Season 2. But at the end of Season 2, I noticed that he is somewhat a boring character.. he is somewhat like a passive character, it's hard to explain.. it's similar like he is not a type of person who speaks very much. At first it crossed in my mind maybe he is a bit psyco because his obsession with Rachel, I mean he really chase her down at the end of the world and wants to dragged her down to his cave despite meeting new good friends and somehow endanger them. If he wants something he has to get it. About MC powers, I really hope he will have a drawback or negative effect from absorbing too many powers. He needs powercheck in Season 3 cause he increased his level abnormally compared to his peers and gain something with minimal efforts. Side Character ToG have interesting character but, the downside is it has too many characters... I mean a lot of sidecharacters only introduced for 1 ark, after that,Author kind of ditched them and make us forgot about them. So, many side characters actually don't have any significant role at all it's better if they don't get introduced at all. I currently read at Season 3 and look, I forgot most of Bam's companion because they are left behind and we will never see them again. (Small example. What's up with Anaak revenge right now? Where is she? Ahh what about glassess girl and big guy from Wangnan's team? Are they forgotten? What's about Leeso's old team? Like Verdi or whatever her name is. Why bother introduced them only for 1 ark and then dissapeared?? Because of too many characters, Author also don't have a good time to develop their characters for example like Androssi/Endorsi. She seems important for season 1 but at season 2 she is only for a driver teleporting people around. She is wasted, I heard from spoiler she will have an important role in Zahard's Princesses Ark far in Season 3 but boii it's actually shows us Author have a bad style developing their characters. Another ones when Bam crying hysterically hearing Jinsung Ha is dead I don't feel any emotion at all, that's because we rarely see any interaction from this character so that's why I don't feel the connection. Story The story it self is good, I like the concept of survival game in floor test but it's sad we rarely see them anymore. It's focus point now about how to take Zahard down. So floor test and climbing the tower is not important anymore. Ahh using strategy, weapons and items also not important anymore for combat its quite sad. I think sometimes Author forget some details, for example like in Season 2 after when Bayrold Yama sent his faithful regular dogs helping Rachel to revive White in Hell Train we don't see any interaction at all between Yama and White 🤔.

Unfortunately, after just 20-30 chapters, the story started to become monotonous and uninteresting. The endings of each chapter feel mundane, lacking any excitement. Additionally, the initial drawings can be difficult to comprehend. The storytelling could have been greatly improved. It lacks engagement and fails to build up any hype or expectations for the next chapter. The absence of romance,comedy and well-executed or impactful fights makes it hard to classify it as an action Manwah. Most of the time, it seems like the writer is uncertain ... of their direction, introducing elements haphazardly, and either taking them too far or not exploring them enough. Tower of God bears a striking resemblance to HxH and shares the common theme of friendship as a major focus, rather than advancing the plot. In fact, it seems to mimic many other Shounen stories, lacking originality. The plot feels scattered and overwhelmed, with numerous unnecessary elements introduced that have no relation to the main storyline, while the main story itself receives too little attention and focus. The main problem lies within the characters themselves. Tower of God introduces a plethora of characters without properly exploring their backgrounds or motivations. All we know about them is that they were born in the Tower and are attempting to climb it. The main character's story revolves around an Irregular who desires to protect his friends, yet the narrative fails to adequately explain why he is important or powerful. Consequently, he comes across as dull, making the surrounding characters equally uninspiring. Strangely, the writer tends to shift the focus to side characters who contribute very little to the main story. In conclusion, Tower of God Manwah falls short in various aspects. Its lackluster storytelling, scattered plot, underdeveloped characters, and unengaging nature make it difficult to recommend to readers seeking an enjoyable and captivating experience."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Tower of God is one of those WebToons which wants to be everything.

The Shinsu system is also a hard-magic system which is great because there are really few shows with hard magic systems. But the problems start piling up. Flaws: 1. All the people who were chosen on the first floor are rising the tower without any problems but the author indicated that the Shinsu concentration increases gradually. So considering it is like our atmosphere, how the heck is everyone climbing up? Is it setting up to be a fairy tail of good vs evil? Although it can be like MHA and deal with a lot of other issues with such a big and expansive world. I do not like the wasted potential. But, still a long way to go for the manga, so just (-1) for unused world. 2. There are so many people that are getting killed in the inner tower that the motive of FUG feels hollow since we haven't seen poor people, slaves, oppression, female rape, any type of effect on normal people which is 10x greater than the candidates.

(NOTE: This review only covers the first ~200 chapters) In short: Tower of God is a great story marred with several flaws that could be a major turn-off to readers. It has the potential to be the best Shounen of all time if the anime adaptation goes well, or the manhwa writing improves, BUT… they’d need to fix the many flaws first. It has a great plot (although it feels pretty straightforward), amazing settings, and great art(later on). The Cringe Factor: ... By far my biggest complaint, this could have easily been the reason I stopped reading this Manhwa. -Overdramatization It feels like the author is overzealous to announce a new character, event, or the beginning of some test EVERY SINGLE F**KING TIME. The exaggeration is ridiculous; every semi-powerful character is overhyped and made to look ridiculously strong or makes a dramatic entrance. It has the webcomic vibe of being some sort of epic, character-driven showdown, but that vibe is plastered on everything, the character’s thoughts, the serious dialogue, and the story itself; fighting to be or kill the most powerful person. It doesn’t really typically have the sob-story character backgrounds of many other Shounen (thankfully), but it instead has half the cast possess powerful weapons and hail from powerful families from the moment they’re introduced. It also has the bad habit of having a random new character, item, or ability enter a fight before being introduced in a text box off to the side, giving the rank, how the power works, accomplishments, etc. -The (lack of) content maturity/consistency When it comes to mature content depicted, it feels like the target audience is somewhere around 10. The depicted violence and blood mirrors Naruto Shippuden at best, but half the time they’ll avoid showing blood or death and keep it in the background or avoid blood altogether. There’s a scene where a character stabs themselves in the chest, but I didn’t realize until I scrolled back up and noticed the knife… their WHITE clothes looked like they’d gotten a little pink dye on them. There’s a few scenes with blood, but they miss plenty of places where it would/should be pooling… The other major factor is the substitute swearing: it’s hilariously unfunny that bitch is used in several instances early on, and bastard throughout, but the characters regularly say friggin and darn, and in far more extreme situations; I’ve encountered damn a few times so idk why darn and dart (drat??) show up constantly in dialogue. It’s just the shitty English translation, but if the translators wanted to keep it PG-13, I feel it might have been better to avoid expletives altogether, or at least avoid substitutes. -The Comments Section This kinda goes for all webtoons, but the comments section is sometimes almost always a cesspool of fangirls drooling over characters, UwUs, and general retardation. Not to mention spoilers. -The Dialogue “How dare you trick me…!!” It feels uninspired and often childish, this could easily be due to the English translation, but the dialogue is lackluster at best, and often very direct. Nearly every character speaks the same way and the verbiage is basic, I’ve never really had this much of the problem in a manga before. Other Complaints: -The Tediousness There are points where the story becomes boring to the point where it’s hard to go on; it’s almost non-stop short battles and they tend to get dull. The character’s run around having to do this and that as part of tests and games that take half a chapter just to explain. The clever plots and strategies (think Naruto) made by characters to defeat their opponents often rely on new rules or techniques outside the knowledge of the reader, and are always explained after they’re used. This is lame and impossible to guess at. The manhwa has a seemingly endless stream of characters and keeping track of them becomes impossible, new characters aren’t introduced one at a time either, each new arc has a multitude, keeping track of who knows what twist and which team or side they’re on is a never-ending task. Mostly Non-Complaints: The Plot/Twists: IMO the storyline has an almost perfect approach to plot twists, it doesn’t twist often, but when it does it twists hard… The plot develops in ways that are fairly unexpected, but they’re unpredictable because they aren’t really hinted at and are taken one step at a time. This causes some developments to feel out of the blue or even forced, but occasionally the developments feel perfectly logical. The plot develops in interesting ways, and is cause for the rare quality conversation in the comments about where the hell it's going. The story has a lot of plot development- and it kinda carries it when it comes to being a great story. The Art: For a while it looks like nothing but Deviantart fanart. If it wasn’t in color it would be boring, the character lines are fairly inconsistent in shape, especially in fights. As the story passes the art gets better and better, eventually reaching the level where half the scenes could be wallpaper. The Story: I’m a bit of a sucker for character hype, and ToG has a ton of it. Numerous characters are shown to be contenders for the most powerful, and having mysterious entities gives hope for future fights. The plot continues building sides and hyping fights do it does at least seem to be going somewhere epic. My fingers are sore from typing so I’m done."}]}

What sets “I Shall Master This Family” (literal Korean translation: “I’ll Become the Matriarch In This Life”) apart is the amazing cast of characters. Tia is THE BIGGEST GIRL BOSS next to maybe Medea from “Your ... Throne”. Tia is a boss, but not because she went back in time, it’s because she was ALWAYS QUALIFIED to be a leader. That’s why she helped her grandfather run their estate in the opening timeline. And the men in this patriarchal story - the obvious good ones - recognize Tia’s genius as a child in the new timeline and SUPPORT HER and raise her up. They are the good ones. Tia’s relationship with her romantic love interest Perez is so sweet and wholesome. POWER COUPLE. Perez is always there for Tia. And there are times where Tia says “No Perez, I got this” and he steps back and lets her run the show. But the romance isn’t even the main theme of this story. At the end of the day, it’s a family story. Tia’s relationship with her father will have you running through the highest highs and the lowest lows. Her relationship with her grandfather is also really endearing. The best parts of this story are by far the family elements. That’s it. I’ll stop here. You should read it. The art is great. The politics are nice and intricate. The pacing is well done. The women are strong - and not at the detriment of the strength of the male characters. The men are absolutely fabulous. Tia’s a joy.

The art style definitely suits the characters and story. It makes it more visually appealing and we have a more realistic take of how the characters look and can easily tell their expressions.

What makes even more enjoyable is that there are no supernatural characters. So no one is over-powered and it lessens the impact of how they’d have to include that and if that happened we would ... have had some boring fight scenes and power explaining.

All of this is told from the perspective of Firentia Lombardi. A korean woman who was reincarnated as the daughter of the famously powerful Lombardi family. The ones who control the market and stand with the same power as the royal family. She watches firsthand as the family falls into ruin due to the incompetence of the successor and she gets kicked out and killed in a carriage accident. Now back in the past as a ... seven-year-old Firentia will save this family from ruin and bend it to her will so her and her father come out on top. This manwha successfully tells the interesting story of a seven-year-old child manipulating events from the shadows to prevent future catastrophe. She leads her dad to success to make sure that he isn't looked down upon in the family like he was in her past life. He even died from a disease in her past life so she makes sure that the person who developed the cure to that disease years later is able to go to medical school a few years early so they could possibly make the cure earlier in this life then they did in the past life. That's what I love about this manhwa, it takes all the standard Otome Isekai troupes and settings and focuses on the scheming behind them. A lot of this manhwa is focused on expanding business and how different families will fight over the market. It's done in a really interesting way. Frientia needs to have these products developed and businesses started but at the same time needs to find allies to do it for her that won't reveal that a seven-year-old is having ideas like these. It's able to put aside the majority of the problems I have with grown people in child body stories and uses it to its full advantage. Beyond the \"saving the family\" stuff the manhwa also focus on the royal family and Frientia getting acquainted with the second prince who is mistreated (and obviously the ML of the story). Once again this is a common troupe but by focusing on the family dispute of bring the second prince back into succession it makes it unique. The story also ties this story to the main story really well by having the incompetent successor of the Lombardi family being manipulated by the Empress who wants the first prince to become the successor and wants to limit the power of the Lombardi family as they are the only family who can rival the royals. Also, just to briefly mention the emperor. He is an asshole, but unlike other asshole emperors in other stories he is an asshole to everyone and enjoys watching the chaos and I like him because of that. He's a wildcard in the political struggle. Another thing I like is that all of the Lombardis have their moment to shine. All of the extended Lombardi family have plot relevance in one way or another and they all feel like interesting and unique people. This story at its core is one about family and having a strongly developed family is a massive plus in its favor. I especially like the relationship between Frientia, her father and her grandfather (the current head of the family). It's developed and feels very natural with the plot using the growing relationship between them to further the narrative.

This story doesn't have superpowers, nobody is able to fly or has super strenght, the ... clichés end on the starting plot, the story is carefully constructed to be EXTREMELY realistic, given its premises, people don't simply love her, everything she has and everyone around her must be conquered, earned, and things are not simply given to her. Deus ex machina resolutions are not around, as well as Mary Sues. Everything just makes sense. About the story, it is about a woman who dies and gets back to its childhood, to make things different.

She is a master schemer, who understands perfectly the limitations of a 7 years old girl, but can't afford to wait for things to unravel while she grows up. She has to intervene, but she is only a little girl. So what does she do? She masterfully directs other people to do the things that need to be done. She makes the right choices, present them to other people, make them do the right thing and, at the same time, pretends to be only a normal girl, who likes flowers and candy and wants to play with her grandfather and father. The art is gorgeous, the characters are extremely likeable, and even her opponents are very well constructed and believable. The story is very thrilling, there are no extreme simplifications that are against the laws of politics or economics and the romance...

A take on the isekai genre in which the main character, Tia, must face her family starting off as a girl on no one's radar and prove that she can be the heir to the family name. Overall score: 8/10; Tia makes for a highly intelligent protagonist. Many times, it seems the true antagonist of the story is not her villainous family members and royals, but rather time itself, as she must race the clock to establish her roots and prevent certain events ... from happening. This results in very few other characters acting as true threats, as Tia is quite a fierce opponent. That said, I recommend this work for specifically the positive relationships she has, especially with her father: the two have a heartwarming bond and they both clearly grow better as people the more time they have with each other. The negative relationships she has with certain characters are intriguing to watch her navigate, but prepare for a rather expert navigation on her part.

We get to see our main character slowly climb the family ladder and grow both in strength and influence. You don't exactly witness her 'growth of experience' since she's intelligent from the start (considering she went back in time and all), so there's a bit of plot armor. Still, the story is very interesting and certainly has key elements that will capture your heart: adorable children, sweet romance, a hot dad, and a cool grandpa. The villains are quite typical, lacking much depth and not eliciting any pity or understanding (though this might change ... as the story progresses, I'm not sure based on what I've read so far). The relationships are indeed wholesome, and you can surely fall in love with every main (good) character since each of them has their unique charm. There's not much lore that the MC isn't already familiar with. Personally, I love reading stories like this from time to time because I enjoy a good badass and smart MC. However, if you're looking for significant character development and actual obstacles that can't be overcome without losses, then this one might not be for you. Overall, I'd rate it 8/10, considering that the description sets clear expectations and the story delivers on them!"}, {"score": "8", "content": "[More info about my review style can be found on my profile] ▶Summary and recommendation: ----------------------------------------------------------------- This is one of the pillars of the otome isekai genre. An absolute recommend to genre fans, or those wanting to check the subgenre out. It is a wonderful light power fantasy / revenge fantasy that is able to keep the tensions up even though the protagonist holds all (or at least a lot of) the cards. ▶Story: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ❗The textile / clothing industry plays a big part in the story, but I am sadly not well versed enough in commerce and textile history to know how accurate or realistic the manhwa handles ... this topic. I do not believe it is too unrealistic. The setup is somewhat contrived and unrealistic, but it sets up an enjoyable story that is about the main character getting revenge and changing her fate. This is mostly done indirectly through anonymous schemes and plots involving commerce or political influence orchestrated by the main character. Quite refreshing for this genre. The setting is that of a generic albeit well realised European medieval setting (in reality, it is closer to early modern setting, but people usually mistakenly call this Medieval). It is however apparent that the author put some extra effort in some parts of the world building. Some genre fans have criticized the pace at which the protagonist ages. Much of the story takes place during her childhood. Too much of it according to some readers. I disagree! There are a myriad of problems that the main character needs to deal with in order to save herself, and there is no logical reason for her to delay until she is older. So a time skip would be disruptive to the story. Instead we get to see the characters grow up incrementally. One day at a time. To me a much more natural pace. ▶Characters: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The protagonist being an \"isekaied\" person is acting a lot more mature than someone her age realistically would, and surrounding characters do not react to it the way they should to seeing her mannerisms.. The story has weakly hinted at other characters dismissing this as her being a prodigy, but I would have liked the story to try and address it more than it does. ▶Romance: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The romance may be a bit off-putting. The characters act older than they should in the field of romance and courtship. Though not *too* much older. Sometimes they display age appropriate misunderstandings and naïvetë. Which is quite charming. ▶Artwork: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The art is gorgeous and it lends itself very well to the story. It does an excellent job at showcasing emotions during tense and emotional moments of the story. The manhwa's intricate dresses and use of earthy colours makes it stand on the top among Otome Isekai art wise."}]}

However, I can affirm that as more and more chapters release, the mystery, action, and lore build on the previous, creating a tense and striking read at all times. Where I have trouble with this is sometimes it’s too tense, as there is just constant rising conflict, where enjoyability isn’t the author’s main goal. To note on the characters, they are spectacularly done. Each individual pertain a personality unique to them, causing emotions of pity, empathy, and attachment to swell. Though, I will say that ... some of them have predictable outcomes and purposes in the story, and it becomes somewhat underwhelming despite all of the former flashbacks to make the readers more attached. Despite this, once the characters hit, they hit. The plot is relatively unique with the Gacha summoning merging with the reincarnated into a game genre. The lore of the story is investing; however, I do find that it’s immensely slow-paced (Manwha will end around chapter 300 at this rate), and there’s a huge risk of using up all the diversity in ideas at the beginning, creating the following chapters to have a “hollow” feeling, as it will be content that has been recycled (this has happened). It is an enjoyable read with not many moments of awe or relaxation, but rather suffering; if that intrigues you, go for it, just don’t expect anything lighthearted. —- A 101 Chapter update: Ill try to keep this short, since MAL technically doesn’t like it when you “update” your reviews but … sorry but not sorry :) This has gotten better than I anticipated, and it seems to be a common trend with this story — I wasn’t a massive fan of it at first, but it continues to grow on me with the passing chapters, since the lore for each character is just amazing and well-thought out. I do have to retract my former points of the lack of enjoyment via conflict, since the story does utilize comedy here and there, and it does it in a way where the serious atmosphere isn’t ruined by some jokes, but it does just enough to make you grin and keep scrolling out of enjoyment/happiness. I still have complaints about reused/boring plot points that the manwha for some reason loves utilizing, but on the bright side, there’s an equal to an even greater amount of unique and interesting storyline directives. One of the very few instances where a story gets better with the amount of chapters, since the lore is so strong. Enjoy!

Ratings first: Art - 10/10 Story - 8.5/10 Character - 7/10 Enjoyment - 9/10 Overall - 8.5/10 First of all, it is set in an incredibly brutal world, where the mc must struggle to survive each floor that he climbs, with comrades who may or may not survive. Whilst of course there are core characters, I have no doubt that many of them will be in the dirt by the end of the series. ... Secondly, the mystery behind the mc's reason for being sucked into the game is fascinating, and is only accentuated further each episode. Instead of bsing the mc's reason for being ultra strong, we see his undying will to survive and while he is given a little boost in the beginning, in no way does that make him op at all. His power is of his own effort, and it's incredibly refreshing. I can only compare it to something like a combination of: AOT, TOG, and L.A.G. (lots of acronyms, I know). Lastly, the development of characters is quite interesting, especially the side characters who seem to be a lot more dynamic as compared to the mc. I'd love to see how he grows, because as of now he is simply a cold and calculated mastermind, of which we've seen the archetype of a million times before.

I love the vibe of making all your weaker starters into ... godlike characters, that's more my vibe, try to make all characters work and disregard the meta. There's like three general story elements that are overarching that we have a lot of questions to remain unanswered: the fate of the MC's world Townia, the fate of Earth and how that factors into the story, and the mysteries of the company who made the game and the upper levels.

A story you must read Pick me up is based on a web novel with the same name and which manages to adapt mostly well. A story that although it may seem simple, is full of mysteries, adventures, difficulties to overcome, sad moments, despair and joy (I know this because although the manhwa is not finished the novel is). The main character Han is one of the most \"human\" characters that I have seen better represented in any manhwa, with a representation of an adult mentality in my opinion very well achieved, some people will confuse him as an EDGY character and I ... think they can not be more wrong. It is a character that is not easy to \"read between the lines\" because little by little he is showing how he is, he is not a character with a past in which he has lived through an ordeal and is looking for revenge. No, his principles are different and the desperation that he and his companions suffer in order to survive every day is what gives emotion to this story and makes the characters be the way they are and act the way they have to. The world in which they live is not an easy world full of roses, NO! It is a cruel world in which the weak die either by the high difficulty fights carried out in the tower or by the care of not being synthesized by their master. A world that brings out the best and the worst of each person that arrives and that only the most capable to adapt to the situation they are in are the ones that have the best chance to survive. --------------------score:------------------- Story: 10 Art: 10 Characters: 10 Enjoy: 10 Overall: 10 ---------------------Conclusion:------------------ Definitely one of my favorite stories that I would recommend to read to anyone (both manhwa and WN) unless you don't like serious stories and with a development full of mysteries. ----------------------------------------------REVIEW EN ESPAÑOL----------------------------------------------------------- Pick me up! Una obra que debes leer Pick me up esta basada en una web novela con el mismo nombre y el cual logra adaptar en su gran mayoria bien. Una historia que aunque pueda parecer simple, esta lleno de misterios, aventuras, dificultades a superar, momentos tristes, de desesperación y de alegría (esto lo se porque aunque el manhwa no este finalizado la novela si lo esta). El personaje principal Han es uno de los personajes mas \"humanos\" que he visto mejor representado en algun manhwa, con representación de una mentalidad adulta en mi parecer muy bien lograda, algunos personas lo confundirán como un personaje EDGY y creo que no pueden estar mas equivocados. Es un personaje que no es facil \"leer entre lineas\" ya que poco a poco el va mostrando como es, no es personaje con un pasado en el que haya vivido por un calvario y anda en busca de venganza. No, sus principios son otros y la desesperación que sufren tanto el como sus compañeros en poder sobrevivir cada dia es lo que le da emocion a esta historia y hace que los personajes sean como son y actué de la forma que tienen que hacerlo. El mundo en el que viven no es un mundo facil y lleno de rosas, NO!! es un mundo cruel en el que el débil muere ya sea por las luchas de alta dificultad llevadas a cabo en la torre o por el cuidado de no ser sintetizados por su maestro. Un mundo que saca lo mejor y lo peor de cada persona que llega y que solo los mas capaces a adaptarse a la situación en la que están son los que mas chance de sobrevivir tienen. --------------------Puntuación:------------------- Story: 10 Art: 10 Characters: 10 Enjoy: 10 Overall: 10 ---------------------Conclusión:------------------ Sin duda una de mis historias favoritas que recomendaría leer a cualquiera (tanto manhwa como WN) al menos que no te gusten las historias serias y con un desarrollo lleno de misterios."}, {"score": "9", "content": "This manhwa... it's like if a gacha game and Darkest Dungeon had wild sex and out popped this beauty. Seriously, it's almost too good to be true, but here we are. As a gacha fan who's spent way too much on rolls, and someone who dabbles in game design, this manhwa hits all the right notes. It's a blend of addictive gacha mechanics, brutal permadeath, and strategic hero management. Have I mentioned about the sex of Darkest Dunge— Yeah, this is their love child. The game design? Genius. You've got an engaging gacha system for the gamblers, idle gameplay that lets you grind while you sleep, and ... endless dungeons with branching plotlines. It's like this manhwa was built for sleepless nights. The permadeath is brutal, but that's what makes it exciting. The challenge is perfect, unlike most gacha games that just hand you easy wins. Plus, leveling up a 1-star hero into a 6-star powerhouse? That’s the dream. The whole system is designed to keep you hooked, and it works. The story? It's solid. Not groundbreaking, but it keeps you invested. The power scaling and gacha mechanics blend well with the narrative, making for a fun experience. I’d give the story an 8 out of 10, but the gameplay design easily pushes the overall experience to a 9. My only gripe? The pay-to-win system. Why can't they just go with a live service model like FFXIV? That would've made it perfect. Even so, I’m still giving this a 9 out of 10 because it’s that good. Honestly, if someone ever makes a game with the depth of RimWorld, the challenge of Darkest Dungeon, and the loot grind of Last Epoch, mixed with gacha mechanics, I'd be the first in line, wallet wide open.

It is more than level up type story, there are a lot different stories going in the behind, and there are still a lot of mysteries need to be solved"}, {"score": "5", "content": "Pick me up (infinite gacha) is an action manhwa series that puts a slight twist on the 'transported to a game' concept. In pick me up the main character is transported to a gacha game he played as a 1 star summon, meaning the weakest possible pull, or just a normal person. He has to use his wits and effort to continue to survive. The main twist here is that aside from game aspects there is actually also a 'player' role in this story, named master, that controls the summons, also known as heroes, that we follow. The main character is tasked with climbing a ... tower with increasingly hard challenges to discover more on why he was transported to the game. This story does a good job of keeping its game aspects relevant. Concepts that you would encounter in gacha games like in game purchases, summons, party selection, daily quests etc are what the narrative is built around and the way this is incorporated is pretty creative. One thing that I feel is worth highlighting though is the whole concept of the society that is forming in the waiting room. The way characters are expected to react to this is honestly ridiculous. The attempted justification is that those who pull their weight are given subsequent rewards but not only is that premise absolutely ridiculous, it is also just not consistent. If a character is not able to fight/provide they are shown as being whiny, lazy or otherwise negative presences deserving of punishment. But for the narrative to make sense the focus should instead be on how helpless these people are against the unstoppable tyrant that is the master. You cannot make the argument that it is dependent on how much the people are willing to work whether they are able to keep living when not every person is predispositioned for fighting, cooking, blacksmithing etc. On the one hand the story tries to show that using synthesis is bad but on the other hand whenever synthesis is used they try to make the people getting synthesized appear like the bad guys for some reason. It is pretty weird and it gives me a very weird feeling of disconnect. Having a story that just showcases a harsh reality works much better than this almost propoganda like piece on why the useless shouldn't be allowed their rights to exist. This also plays into how the story treats the main character. The MC is your average cold and composed strategic mastermind type which can definitely be done well, but the way the story treats him is inconsistent. This story constantly warps morality around the main character. What the MC does is never allowed to be wrong, inefficient, morally grey etc. If he does something that might appear to the audience as wrong it is always warped to seem like the compassionate choice or the least wrong one. It really pulls you out of the story as the way the gacha game is played is a major part of the narrative which is intertwined with how the MC played. Our MC is also not very consistent in how he carries himself. He takes contradictory actions and how he acts just does not at all align with how the narrative wants the reader to view him. This also leads to some pretty misplaced 'emotional' moments that feel picked straight out of a textbook on how to do story beats more so than feeling correct in the setting. More largely, the characters in this series just are not a focus. They are flat, uninteresting and usually have one defining trope. It makes any character heavy scene feel very out of place and any stakes feel unimportant. Luckily, the focus is instead on the action, world building and mystery. The world building in this series is a bit hit or miss in my opinion. The idea behind the world building is pretty cliche. Tower stages being reflections of actual societies and some of the other concepts done in this story are interesting but have been done better before by stories like suicide hunter, the tutorial is too hard, omni reader and even the tower of wish arc from the novels extra to name a few popular ones. What has been pretty unique is the mystery surrounding the game itself. This mystery is well tensioned and leaves you wanting to know more. The art is very good, action manhwa readers are generally pretty spoiled regarding art quality. This series has a very dynamic action style and generally looks fantastic. It is also consistent and aside from maybe looking a bit too standard at times I don't really have anything to complain about in this regard, definitely a highlight of the series. Overall I think this series is decent if a bit bland. While the concept is more unique than the most standard action series this is only marginal and the uniqueness of the blend of ideas does not make up for how one note the character writing and world building can be. I also really dislike how this story treats the waiting room and the society that forms. Neither angle is portrayed well and there is neither tension for the characters we care about nor a feeling of fairness. It just feels weird. If you are following a villain type character that would be perfectly fine. But in this manhwa we are following someone with a similar mindset that is instead heralded as the savior who can do no wrong, except for the plebs who do criticize him who happen to be all bad in some way and are punished for their actions. It just feels weird and for me personally it is a reason to drop this manhwa."}, {"score": "8", "content": "The basic premise of the story is the main character gets summoned as hero in a Gacha game he's a top player of, where he's offered limited freedom outside of combat encounters although the MC specifically can make suggestions to the player. It's a very unique story where the MC not only has to progress like any other RPG Manhwa, but has to manage the community of heroes while subtly guiding the player to success without being too suspicious. Pick Me Up! focuses much more on the party dynamics than other Manhwa because of the party-oriented nature of the Gacha game genre, it does a great ... job of getting you invested in every main character's progression and success, something that RPG Manhwa typically have trouble with as the overpowered MC overshadow the rest of the cast, turning other characters into cheerleaders on the sideline. We know the MC is probably safe despite not being that overpowered because of his special role in the story, so he can never fail a mission without dying (and the story ending or shifting completely) but the author is still great at coming up with scenarios for the different levels, and writing out an interesting plotline where they barely eek out a victory. The story does a great job of portraying a sense of desperation and urgency but the repeated use of this theme does drag on during the combat encounters a bit too much IMO, would like to see a bit more variety in how they can challenge the characters rather than run out a timer. Paradoxically, as they focus more on characters they do seem to become safer which lowers the stakes a bit, but it's an easily resolvable issue so it's not that big of a deal.

The concept of the \"Master\" is interesting as the characters are subjected to the whims of the master and may be \"synthesized\" if the master deems so.

Also the world building is too expanded and not consolidated properly. Another thing is the MC's personality is that he's the cool composed guy who can do no wrong.

Yes, the NPC's stories are integral to the story. They are ancient stories long ago, from another world, and eventually, end with tragedy. This manhwa is not just about hitting hard and saving hot female girls. No, it's about exploring other stories with a cast that are wary of each other but also have abilities that even the main character struggles with. Yes, the main character is powerful, with probably the most overpowered ability, but the people around him are amazingly talented too and are respected individuals to remember. Not only that, the main character can insert what type of ending he's going for, and thankfully he's not the type to go, \"Kill everything, fuck other people, I'm the most right person in this tower,\" he's got an actual interest in facilitating his connection to the world in a positive way.

However, justice is still justice and devotion is still devotion.\" Even in a world where none will know the pain of his recurring deaths, Kim Dong Ja will continue to push forward. The common people he saves will never be good, the crowd he saved will never be honorable. Yet, none of them will feel the pain of death, which Dong Ja has felt innumerable times. It is truly poetic that the one who desperately died so that they can live is the one who will prevent the death and suffering of others. A truly introspective story about human suffering and what it means to be kind, and the story of a man's desperate climb to bring the best ending to everyone else. With engaging action, good art, compelling characters and light hearted comedy to lighten the mood, suicide man is a story that will truly keep you at the edge of your seats and pull you in deep into their emotional worlds.

But having a title like that does not necessarily make this story also shocking. On the contrary, there are so many surprising aspects that can make you feel amazed, especially if you look at the aspect of the main character’s point of view. Namely someone named Kim Gongja. The author’s courage in exploring the depth of Kim Gongja’s character is very brilliant in my opinion. Starting from the way he introduced Kim Gongja from a character who had a deep sense of envy to ... become a character who could save an Empire. I can’t discuss this too deeply because it could enter the realm of spoilers. So it would be better if you read it yourself. Right? For the art aspect. Well, this is also a plus value from this manhwa. The artist of this manhwa can draw several characters brilliantly. And what I like the most is the design of the monster The Demon King of Autumn Rain, which in my opinion has an extraordinary design for a demon lord class. I can’t find a design as good as this in other manhwas. In summary, this series is an essential series that you must read if you want character development that is unusual, as well as cool art, and of course a unique world setting. The key is, this series is not a “Power Fantasy”"}, {"score": "10", "content": "One of the best manhwas I have read in a long time. All the characters are well introduced and fleshed out. The plots have actual meaning and no implicit sexism, racism or homophobia at all. Not only that, but they explore great themes and different ‘life-purpose-esk” topics with very considered, entertaining and immersive. Unexpected seeing how generic and cliche the you feel the beginning is. The power system is not over explained that it rivals the plot, but enough that you can truly focus on the storytelling and world building. BELOW CONTAINS VERY VERY VERY SLIGHT ALLUSIONS TO THE PLOT. It won’t ruin the element ... of suprise, but if u want to go in blind - it’s a good read. Although he receives a “op skill”, it is not something that gives immediately bestows omnipotence, but when used well and cleverly, because a create tool to empower and fulfil the MCs wishes. And despite what could have been a complicated power system, it is explained perfectly so you can understand the power levels, the importance of certain skills and their utilisations, without having to mind-bend or be dumped with chucks of knowledge. This makes it very readable and considered enough that you aren’t confused on how the world works so you can focus more so on the plot and emotions. I also just personally really like the MC. His humble attitude, smart and strategic brain, continuous drive to learn and grow more, and goal to do so much “good” makes him personable and like a character I really want to succeed. Plus it honestly is so surprising not to see implicit sexism and homophobia. It is SOOO reassuring. It is so normal for comics to try and mould their characters to rigidly fit into and enforce gender stereotypes on themselves and Rothers either through “I have power, I can finally become a man! This is what any man should do despite their level of power and despite the fact that it is unattainable for poorer/weaker people and not what I used to do!”, “You are someone not me (almost always a women) and I need you to do nothing while I do everything. But u can make me food ig.” Or just even an out of pocket, irrelevant to the plot “you are fat, you really need to cut down” or “It’s fine to be gay but don’t show any signs of it with me”. Instead of those fillers or punching down humour, it constructs nuanced takes on far deeper topics - morality, life’s purpose, love. It doesn’t just go beyond the binary good and bad, it extends further to look at what makes the bad bad, and provides a clear, nuanced, and open minded resolution that is so well reasoned, well foreshadowed, unpredictable, and satisfying. no hyper sexualisation of women or children. Only points that could seem less considered are: - MCs internal struggle with deaths/trauma/suicide aren’t really… expanded on how it would realistically affect his constant mental state. - MC’s suicide count increases throughout the series, but the number doesn’t. V MINOR n insignificant, but just the only other critic. In summary, it’s a good, green flag, mind provoking, well thought out manga. It was a surprising find, but I’m glad to have read the first 3 seasons / 115 chapters. Each storyline is just CHEF KISSES.

So if that bothers you, be warned. 8/10 definitely recommend"}, {"score": "10", "content": "The only time I will ever write a review for anything. This is a masterpiece and I wish I could read this fucking again for the first time. This webtoon single handly made me visit the genre of light novel and novels. First of all, I wanna just mention that I usually get extremely engaged in something that interest me a lot, so if something is bad, I'd likely feel it too, and this goes the same way if its good. If a scene is done well and supposed to make you cry or feel warmth, I will feel it. Anyways on to the review. Character: ... 10/10 Kim Gonjga and everyone around him is easily one of the best characters I've ever read. Kim gongja is a person with extremely good mental strength and always strives to get the best ending possible, and I can say he definitely does that. I'm not good with words so the best way I can describe him is something like selfless. The main character Kim Gongja also understands the true price of a regressor, even if he has infinite lives, he cannot replicate everything, the emotion he felt and the relationship he gain had to be sacrificed in order to get the perfect ending. When he travels back in time to a time where the relationship wasn't made, it hurts him, like it really does. Also, take in mind, he is human. Theme: 10/10 I'm just gonna say this is one of the best part of the story. This author probably had like 100 good stories he wanted to write but he condensed it into a small webtoon like this and it is just fucking glorious. Every theme between the tower floors is always just so incredible. Even if you are skeptical at first (like me), it just plays out amazingly. I would love to write pages and pages of each of the 3 main arc that can be read in the webtoon currently, but that would spoil the story. Sometimes I would just be in the bathroom and just think about how each part plays out fucking perfectly and I cannot love it more. The most recent 3rd arc (the romance one0, I didn't think I would like at first but, man. Its fucking incredible, I'm embarrased to say but I've fallen in love before and this is one of the greatest depiction of love. The struggle when you don't see the girl and how even the air seems to smell like her, it is just so real. Some people who hasn't ever fallen in love cannot agree with those points and think its creepy but those who has, can confirm what I just said. Story: 10/10 The beginning is 'slow'. Not really for me, but its easy for someone to think otherwise. Due to the horrendous name of this manhwa, people often think its some overpowered regressor and I dont blame them. Currently the webtoon has 126 chapters and it is currently beginning its 4th main arc, I won't spoil anything but gad damn, you are in for a fucking treat. I also want to mention the panelling of everything, WOW. The panelling is like so insanely unique that this is easily the best adaption of any novel ive seen. In the novel for example, if it went something like 'This guy isn't a person with heart, his book control his everything, he is not even a human with desire.' ok kinda corny but, if that's how it went in the novel, the manhwa would change kim gongja's gaze to a disappointment one and the person he looked at would straight up just become words and only the outline of the person could be seen, usually a novel would just skip over a part like this but this one doesn't and it is eiwrvquiwrhue9vqrqewounhivuioh. I fucking love it. Conclusion: 10/10 This is one of the greatest piece of fiction I've ever read, geniunely. The greatest depiction of love. The greatest depiction of a struggle of regressor. The second greatest display of emotion (The horizon beats this, still good asf). The greatest panelling. This manhwa has EVERYTHING PLEASE READ THIS. I CANNOT STAND THIS BEING SO UNKNOWN. Even though theres people like gigguk who has talked about this webtoon, it still lacks recognition compared to something like omniscient viewpoint reader, or in the webnovel section, Lord of the mysteries. Anyways this is really fucking good. I didn't even double check this review so uhh there might be some spelling mistakes."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Big fan of ORV and Solo Leveling? Then this one is probably also for you. Story - Admittedly, this story starts about as generic as can be. There's an established tower to climb, but the rules of it are unclear, and our hero wants to be able to climb its ranks just like his favorite hunter. Nothing more is established about Confucius as a character, and honestly nothing more will be for another 100 chapters. For a power fantasy story however, this works just fine as the MC's backstory is rather inconsequential. For the first dozen or so chapters the story is by the books, with the ... only twist being the MC's 24 hour returnee ability upon death and skill-gain from murder. Then the reader gets to chapter 15. If the first few chapters are really not appealing to you I strongly suggest at least getting through chapter 15 before dropping. For many, that was the chapter that added an emotional depth to the tower and its inhabitants that makes the reader want nothing more than to find out what's going to happen next. The story takes its time with arcs. Each setup for a stage is thoroughly developed before it gets to the crux of the action, though admittedly some arcs feel like they're a bit drawn out because of this. The culmination of each makes it worth it in the end however, and the reader feels satisfied when each wraps up. Characters - Although we don't know much about Confucius before he gets his skills, we see through his actions and choices in the story what kind of man he is. He's a slightly twisted, egotistical man who loves praise but also likes to feel like he actually earned it. He's a fun character to follow, and he works best with the straight men that tend to surround him and react to his craziness. The depth and characterization of the female characters Confucius meets is particularly impressive. There's no harem here, and when a woman starts to admire Confucius or help him it feels earned and not just because the rules of shonen say it must be. They also come in a variety of designs and ages, none of which feel sexualized for the sake of clicks. Art - Starts pretty generic but comes into its own as the story goes on. Well done and the action flows logically and smoothly. Nitpicks (MILD NON-CRITICAL SPOILERS) - One issue that I did keep coming across was unfortunately the author often seemed to forget when they would establish the events were being broadcasted to others. Often confucius would say or do things that surely the audience that was watching him should be freaking out about, but it's never addressed (this is largely for the library arcs). One example was Confucius openly discusses his martial arts master familiar at the end of the heavenly demon arc, which should have made the blade master flip when he saw it on the broadcast, but it was never addressed again and there were no consequences. Another was unfortunately the artist seemed incapable of drawing a female character any other age than 20s, despite whatever the canon age was supposed to be. Some could be rationalized away with magic or skills but it sometimes made it hard to tell the age difference dynamics between the MC and some of the women he met on his journey. It didn't even occur to me the Black Witch was meant to much older than Confucius until well into the story because of the way she was drawn, for example. Comparisons to other popular series are impossible to ignore as well. By the end of the first major tower arc, the reader might immediately draw connections to the set of abilities a certain Sung Jinwoo possesses and the one Confucius gains in this arc. Not only that, but the style of tower communications becomes very reminiscent of ORV as the story progresses. These things aren't bad enough to cry imitation and the story stands well enough on its own, but the comparisons can be pretty blatant. Finally, I am worried about how the story will now develop after the events of the romance storybook arc. To put it vaguely, by the end of this arc Confucius has a force tied to him that makes his suicide/murder trump card nearly impossible to use without consequence to his conscience. Being that is his first and most intrinsic ability I worry where the story will go with it so limited. This is also the arc that will make or break a lot of fans of this series as it is such a far departure from what occurred in the past near 100 chapters. Its pretty non-traditional for this kind of story, but I enjoyed it anyway. Overall I highly recommend this series if you're looking for a good power fantasy tower climber with an interesting twist of skills. It's reminiscent of the hits, but also stands proudly on its own two feet. If you're questioning whether it's the manhwa for you, at least give it 15 chapters to tell if it's the kinda story you would want to stick with."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Dont worry guys review if spoiler free😚 Manhwas never can compare themselfs to mangas, mangas are in overall almost always better BUT there are verry few, that can stand proud with mangas and this gem is one of these.

Based on art, powerscaling, plot, relationships and character development for now its a solid 9/10 just because its still an ongoing manhwa. I can’t give it a 10/10 because i might left it marinating for too long that i could simply forgot that this manhwa ever existed and it could continued badly. ... So i’m playing it safe by giving it a 9/10. Right now i just finished reading chapter 121. Plot wise, it is the typical generic tower/system.

The pacing is not too fast and also not too slow which is good. Maybe if i could add a little bit of something for this manhwa. I would give it a little bit of filler relaxed chapter just to give the story arc a bit of a breather. But so far it doesn’t feel overwhelming, its still in a good pace. What i like about this manhwa is, the bonds that the MC made so far doesn’t disappear in a thin air like some manhwa that i’ve read. Its well maintained and serve well for the plot setups. Every single thing that of the MC has done has always causality calculated, in a fantasy world that anything could happen the MC is kinda abusing his power BUT in a good way of abusing it. He utilize logics, cool and collected demeanor in any of his choices. My way of describing the MC is he’s simply a chad rezero Subaru with a good sub category regressing ability or it is if its Batman who could regress. He is calm and calculated and foremost is he isn’t as naive and childish like Superman. He is vigilant but not as cold blooded like Frank Castle.

Man the first one going really insane he does everything really dark, it cost his life. Determination is really strong here, i like him. The weakness of this season 1 is lack of mental being death multiple times. ... There is none, they probably show it in novel but in adaptation there is none. They also show how bad the world is and how bad the human is also, in every possible way. Ok thats enough season 1 review Season 2 review, this is one of biggest let down, i dont know its novel fault or adaptation fault, but clearly author do really wrong thing. First thing, there are so many plothole everywhere, no explanation, no single clue around. I read people comment reasoning which make sense how the plot running but again, people who dont know, will forever dont know till they look for it. Second one, mc action kinda no justify by situation they are get into, Instead doing safe option which develop something to do something, he beg to learn something b*llsh*t that not even single clue that can solve current problem.

There ain't much to tell beyond that - characters are one dimensional and do not ... make you care for them, they are strong/weak solely depending on what plot needs them to be at the current moment. I would say 6/10 is what I would give it overall BUT it's the type of manhwa where enjoyment factor is supposed to be higher than overall quality. And in terms of enjoyment - read the pros/cons above and decide if you will be able to enjoy it. Those who do enjoy it will have a pleasant experience."}, {"score": "6", "content": "oh boy oh boy this manhwa it's really something for sure, first of all if you hate and despise loli fanservise as i do, don't read this shi as the first 50 chapters or so are basically fanservise, it does go away tho thank god, idk why people are into loli shi tbh like bro there's thick latinas everywhere and yo ass going for a child ngl that's fucked up, also this author was going overboard with that shi i dropped this because of the fanservice but picked it back up because i was told it went away after, anyways enought talking about thick latinas ... and let's get back with the review.

Well, post-apocalyptic world is one of the topics I really enjoy reading and I find it super interesting in what the story of Leviathan is like, a world where everything was consumed by water and people's only chance to survive is on the surface in boats that serve as homes. The interesting thing is that to survive the characters sometimes have to go to the part where civilization existed, I really enjoy this type of exploration in search of supplies and collect parts that can be used to build weapons or even improve the durability of boats. The story presents us with three ... characters in which apparently we will follow this tense and frightening journey, but in the first chapters the protagonist's Father leaves us and not to mention that he didn't even have much time to be developed, I know that in stories like that, someone will eventually die in the beginning and that's what happened. Not that it's bad, but I think a lot of people end up not liking seeing a character where we barely had time to empathize with him. But we know that in post-apocalyptic works we don't have time to create a bond with any character. There is also the factor of the characters having to collect rainwater as they are completely surrounded by salt water or do the desalination process and as everyone knows. And that was something I always wanted to see in a post-apocalyptic story and Leviathan provided me with this moment. Thermal distillation, or evaporation, mimics the natural cycle of rain to promote desalination. By means of energy, which can be fossil or solar, sea water is heated and thus changes from a liquid to a gaseous state. I think it's so amazing to see this in games/books and movies and not to mention that the work really gives a feeling that we are the characters themselves. The characters are one of the strongest points of the work, charismatic and interesting and I hope they continue to evolve with each passing chapter, Kana is already a character who will definitely be one of my favorites in the work. Ah, the manhwa art is wonderful in many ways, each panel is very well detailed, the character design is also very well detailed and if you count in the \"Sea Monsters\" each one has a kind of look and one more bizarre than the another, experiencing a feeling of despair/distress and discomfort and not to mention that they have some reactions when they suffer some kind of eye damage. The story has great potential to become one of my favorites and when it comes to the post-apocalyptic world, I get very excited to see where the story will go and I hope it keeps surprising me more and more. If you like post-apocalyptic themed artworks I think maybe you should check out Leviathan."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Overall, a very good manhwa. And much of this is due to the work's entertainment, which easily hooks you into reading, with impeccable visual quality, very colorful and detailed scenes, not to mention the action scenes that are really sensational. The plot of the work is nothing special, but it is \"okay\". Everything mentioned puts the manhwa in that position, but it also has some shortcomings. The main negative point is the lack of development of many of the characters that are important to the plot. Some simply appear and die as if they were nothing, others (very important) stay several chapters and suddenly ... die too, without having the worthy recognition they deserved. Another very annoying flaw was the fact that the work started to get very \"rushed\" in the final stretch, and that was terrible because we all expected a worthy ending for the story and it turned out to be a bad ending, not because of what happened but the WAY it happened ( very fast without any development), mainly due to the fact that during the whole work there was a \"subplot\" of romance between the MC and Kana, but they didn't finish it in any way, it ended up being an \"implicit\" romance between them, something unfinished. The feeling that passes is that maybe there will be a continuation, there is a gap for that. But if it's not in the author's interest, at least make some special chapters showing and ending, once and for all, the lives of the protagonists after all. Then it will be a \"masterpiece\"."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Honestly, solid. This was one of the few stories where it felt super easy to binge read and I finished it in 2 days. The art is really good. I really like the vibrant style and the designs on the characters are unique and cool. The characters are likable and I could see more than one of them being my favorite. And the pacing, oh my the pacing is one of the best I have seen in manhwa. Holyyyy. The story starts, they have an issue, the character grows, they have a climax and the story ends nicely.

I'm a fan for those end-of-the-world stories where the hero fights to survive and protect their loved ones. The artwork in the manhwa is truly impressive and satisfying (erotic?). From the character designs to the intense fight scenes and those scaaaaaaary monsters, some of them really sent shivers down my spine. The story is full of drama and some seriously mind-blowing plot twists. However, character development fell ... a bit short for most of them. Bota got some good growth, but the others deserved more focus or maybe more time to live? xD What seems missing in this manhwa is its romantic side; it's not clear at all. At first, I thought Bota and Sonia would hit it off, but then suddenly, he's all into Kana? (she's like 20 years older, man) It felt a bit random, and we didn't even get a proper ending for that relationship. As for the ending, it was... alright. It felt a bit rushed, especially compared to some other story arcs which had more focus and more chapters. \"The Human's Last Attack\" could've been better. Overall, \"Leviathan\" stands out as one of the best manhwas I've read.

Sure some of the action is excessive with constant battles but for me this is a plus ... given that all the battles add to the story climax. The plot is well written from start to end as even at the end things are linked to the very beggining with very subtle cues on what is to come.

Right off the bat, the art comes in swinging. HARD. Every panel is incredibly detailed and fully rendered in color. Not once does the artist compromise on quality throughout the entire story. They practically demand that you slow down reading just to fully appreciate the amount of work that went into each panel---every glistening wave, every grotesque creature, every gory kill---they each deserve that extra few seconds of your attention if you can spare. The worldbuilding is where this story shines. With the earth fully covered in an ocean infested ... with sea monsters, not to mention mankind dwindled to so few in number, it makes every loss of life and salvaged material that much more impactful. It's a hostile world to survive in, so there's many creative ways humans have made their homes. Most islands are simply just the tops of skyscrapers still left standing, and their inhabitants depend on diving into the ruins of ancient cities in order to salvage material and supplies despite the ever-present threat of bloodthirsty sea monsters roaming around every corner and fathom. Although, some readers have faulted the logic of the sea level's height: if some buildings still stick out of the water, then how is there no land at all when mountains reach so much higher? Even Mt. Everest is submerged (presumably). Well, the author's explanation is that humanity slowly moved their cities to the highest points in the world as it flooded. You may need a little suspension of disbelief, but it's not really an issue given how cool the premise is. The plot, characters, and themes aren't particularly deep or complex; but that's not necessarily a bad thing. They work well enough, and what makes the characters stand out is the amount of hardship and death they are forced to endure. The main character, Bota, is given a lot of potential, but he mostly gets sidelined in favor of the characters around him. The two final criticisms that often come up with this manhwa (and I do have to agree with) are one, Kana's... um, outfit. Despite being the strongest character in the story (both literally and figuratively), her clothes are quite revealing, making her fight scenes jarring and sometimes silly even. Thankfully, this quickly gets rectified by the artist and this no longer becomes an issue later on. The other critique comes with the \"romance,\" if you really want to call it that. Given certain contexts, it can come off as weird. However, it's one-sided and ends up pretty much just getting dropped altogether. Overall, whenever there is an issue, it seems like the author/artist takes the feedback and fixes them---which is quite refreshing in this day and age, honestly. Leviathan is worth reading for its exquisite art and world, and for that of its raw brutality. If you like Waterworld or Attack on Titan, this is a must read. If you like both, then you're sure to love it."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Pros: Art is unique and amazing. Side characters all have unique personality's and are awesome.

Early on I worried the story would feel too short or take a turn for the worse, since the narrative or character writing aren't anything exceptional. But despite there being some obvious issues, it held up well throughout. Great art, great setting, great fights and a decent story. - - - - I love the setting. The earth is completely submerged with water, with humans having to live on ships that float on its surface. During the day people can go about their day as they please, but as the night falls, this fragile peace fades away. ... Hostile marine life surfaces, and dozens, even hundreds of massive leviathans come to prey on humans. The human colonies are on massive boats that have turned into dystopian cities—somewhat reminiscent of the images you'd see from the Kowloon Walled City—held together by duct tape and dreams. Early on the setting for Leviathan seems really promising, and it does exceptionally well with the world-building and horror. Unfortunately it mostly stops expanding the world and starts deviating from the horror aspects. The setting is just a springboard to have a ton of bloody badass fights against enormous sea monster with OP main characters. Realism is thrown out the window. This might seem like it'd tank the overall quality, but with how great the art is, and how each fight maintains a fairly fresh feel, it simply manages to be a great action manhwa. I think if the writer had managed to intertwine the initial premise alongside its action packed story, the story would have been better. - - - - The overall narrative is not the best thing ever. I think there is a clear idea of a beginning and end that is followed through fairly well, with some solid character progression, good pacing and a satisfying conclusion that didn't make the story feel too short or dull at any moment... But there are some notable flaws. Although the overall structure and narrative idea is quite good, the writer seems to be a bit whimsical with everything else. This \"whimsy\" started quite early, as the first few episodes felt like a quite mature horror story, but then turned into a very action and fan-service focused read. Then after a while the fan-service is gutted shortly after. One of the bigger issues is that there were many subplots that started, but which never found proper conclusions. This issue ranges from side characters to the main cast in varying degrees. We see some side characters whose personal growth and motivations seem to shift around too much, and this results in them having a slightly inconsistent personalities. There were also some romantic subplots that started, but were either cut short or disappeared entirely—only for the involved characters to later be in an entirely different state of mind. Overall it doesn't ruin the comic, but it certainly holds it back from reaching greater heights. Especially for those who want a truly strong narrative. Another issue is definitely the final act being slightly rushed. While definitely an issue, it wasn't a huge negative to me, as it still managed to reach a fairly satisfying conclusion. - - - - Leviathan definitely falls in the \"shounen\" categorization, but in my eyes it's one of the greatest ones. There was also an afterstory that's out, which hasn't been categorized on MAL yet, which allowed me to have more of an appreciation for the whole package than some of the earlier readers. Anyhow, if you love action and want to see fights against sea monsters, or if the setting intrigues you, I urge you to give Leviathan a try."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Spoilers on the last half- One of the damn best works of dark fantasy survival story I have ever read in my life.

Funny thing is that there's not even a way of getting away from these monsters, because ... everything is covered in water... not having a possible chance of swimming away or dealing with them at night because you're just too fucking slow and these monsters get sliced up and don't even flinch is just something great if you like horror genre. The story in general is really good, with nice plots and foreshadowing. The fantastic scenery art or the drawings in general is something that should be talked about.

Every manga, manhwa, webtoon or some shit can always can have their score turned upside down as the final chapters are released, but I can’t say that to Leviathan, the finale is good.

The early chapters were very engaging to read, and I even thought that with a concept like this, the manhwa had the potential to be something like Attack on Titan. But after I got to the time skip, I was confused, though ... I brushed it off. From the time skip to the end, there were a lot of flaws, especially in the way the author wrote the story. I don’t know why it felt like the story was being rushed to end quickly, and the ending itself felt too plain and flat. The author of this manhwa lacked greater imagination, even though the concept had the potential to be much better.

All of this is to say that I am a little sleep deprived and may not be judging this work properly. Anyways, I think this work is a solid 8/10 it gets heavily carried by its art which is stunning and even after 200 chapters still amazes me. I would say the story does not do anything too crazy ... but it is complete and can be fairly emotional at times. I certainly did not see all the twists, it could be my impaired judgment from sleep deprivation, but I like to believe it is the story doing something interesting. Fair warning to those who do start this, the beginning can be a little rocky there is some strong fan service which took me out a bit, but for some that is a bonus. Also, the length of the chapters threw me off as well being short and sometimes a recap could take up a quarter of the chapter. Even with these downsides, if you are looking for an compelling apocalypse/fantasy manhwa that combines raft with alien fish monsters and has a complete story that does not feel rushed. I would say give Leviathan a try. NOTE: I would suggest listening to an action playlist on Spotify while reading this manhwa it definitely helps also the show is manhwa is complete if you are wondering"}]}

The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.\" –Pablo Picasso Is life a free reality, or a fated game? What happens if you don’t fit into the mold that society wants you to fit in? Can you keep those crazy dreams and beliefs that you had as a child when you move onto adulthood? What's the different between being a child and being an adult? Is great success the most important thing in life? Can you force yourself to just not grow up? What is happiness? This is the very first manhwa (Korean Manga) that I've ever ... read, and I was very impressed; not like a \"that was pretty good\", but like a \"this changed my life\". Although I was reluctant to actually read something when I didn't have to, I gave Annarasumanara a try, and now I'm dying to read other manhwas. Annarasumanara makes my English class' \"deep\" books seem silly and pointless. The story of Annarasumanara was quite straightforward, yet had a mysterious, genius and very touching aspect to it. Although the main synopsis of the manhwa may turn you off because of the \"magic\", I assure you that the manhwa doesn't have any supernatural magic powers in it. Annarasumanara is truly a heartwarming story about what it means to be an adult and what must (or must not) change when growing up. It also touches on issues like bullying, social expectations, parental pressure, truly understanding yourself, what you want in life, and what you are willing to/should give up or put up with to be your own form of happy. The magic of growing up. Background Info: There are rumors about a mysterious magician; one that can make people disappear and change people's lives forever. They say that if you go to the old carnival, you'd see a dashing young man wearing a magician's hat — a man who can perform the greatest magic, but before he does any magic, he will look you in the eye, stare at your deep soul with his grey eyes and ask, \"Do you believe in magic?\" So now I ask you, do you believe in magic? If so, What kind of magic? Is magic worth believing in? Could one claim that our lives and this world that we live in are magical as well? If you had one wish, what would it be? The beauty of \"magic\", is that people can perceive what's truly magical in their own terms; and this \"magic\" can be the brightest, most happy thing in a person's life, but it can also be what horrors, and misfortunes of a person's life. Perhaps people refuse to believe in anything supernatural, but are supernatural things the only things that are considered \"magical\"? The story revolves around Yoon Ai, a very smart girl in her class who struggles to feed herself and her sister everyday. She just wants to become an adult faster so that she can get a job and escape from the poverty and the reality of her current situation. That all changes when she meets the rumored magician, Lee Eul who asks her, \"Do you believe in magic.\" The story then proceeds to show Yoon Ai's develop in behavior and attitude towards living life. Lee Eul reminds Yoon Ai of her of innocent childhood, and of her memories and dreams that she had as a child. But the harshness of reality never lets her go and the story moves forward, showing Yoon Ai's hard choices in life that decide her fate. The plot also delves into Lee's childhood past and his refusal to grow up/failure as an adult, thus creating his isolation from society. Lee Eul and Yoon Ai's perspectives of the world and their fates intertwine with one another, creating the ideal story about poverty as a child, struggle to find a place in society, making friends, and growing up while trying to find your own happiness in this unfortunate world. Whenever you think the story is trying to set a positive tone, you get heartbroken by the tragic events that follow afterwards. Whenever you think that there really is \"magic\", it gets crushed by reality. It's a deep, dark, emotionally gripping manhwa that has sort of made me depressed with the truth about our society today, in the end of the manhwa, it ambiguously emphasizes that there will be a \"light at the end of the tunnel\". The ending was absolutely perfect; it left me crying. Every aspect of this manhwa deserves a 10/10, but I'd say the plot deserves an 11/10; easily the best, most interesting and touching story I've ever read about. The plot itself is ambiguous as well. What is the truth in life, and what is the right way to live life? What each character believes is the \"truth\" is never fully revealed in the manhwa, despite them choosing their own paths, if that makes sense. The themes presented in the manhwa, are pretty blatantly presented though, which I liked; better than trying to be all confusing and deep. The magic in this story is also a little ambiguous. You are never for certain if the magician really turned Ai’s holey tights into pretty polka-dotted ones (bad, harsh past -> moving on into a \"better\" life, nor are you for sure if the magician is really has a mailbox that sends a letter to anyone, no matter what. The magic in Annarasumanara is something that you have to believe in yourself, and that only helps send the message of \"believing\" even further. There are basically only 3 (main) characters in the entire manhwa. First, Yoon Ai, whose development through her encounter with the mysterious yet childish magician is the entire story. Yoon Ai's past is filled with hardship. Her mom is dead, her father ran away from home,causing her to have to work on part time jobs & deal with the debt collectors who are looking for her dad while looking after her younger sister and keeping her in school. Then there's the magician, Lee Eul whose character is unveiled gradually in an artistic fashion. And finally, Na Il-Deong, Yoon Ai's classmate who seems to have everything, yet there's something important missing in his life. Il-Deong's interactions with Yoon Ai and Lee Eul, open him up into a \"new world\" in which he finds the missing piece of his life. No other character's were developed in depth, but it really wasn't necessary either, since the entire plot worked perfectly with just these 3 characters; an impressive feat. The characters were very realistic in their own sense. All 3 of them has had a different childhood, from poverty to average to rich, yet all of them are related in a way. The readers can easily connect to each one of the characters. As a child, what did we want to become? When we grow up, did it stay the same? What kind of hardships did you have to go through to go from a child to an adult? Looking back on your past, do you regret the choices you made? The art was stunningly magnificent. The manhwa has pages without words which still manage to say a lot of things through the beauty of the art. The facial expressions portrayed by the characters express their emotions exquisitely. Furthermore the background is also very detailed and has the unique ability to draw attention to the stunning bits of details. Visually Mesmerizing! Annarasumanara was needless to say, absolutely enjoyable. There's nothing to not like about the manhwa: the plot was touching, creative, genius and well executed; the characters were interesting, thoroughly developed, and relatable. As a growing teenager myself, I often scoff at and enjoy my present, reminisce about my past, and dream about my future. The art in the manhwa was so beautiful, how can people be so artistic?! And do I believe in magic? I don't believe in the magic powers, but I believe in magical things: family, friends, miracles, and memorable moments that I cherish or immensely regret. I recommend this manhwa to everyone, and I can promise you that none of you will be left disappointed. Perhaps the greatest piece of writing I've ever read. Thank you Ha, Il-Kwon for creating Annarasumanara, for allowing me the chance to read such an excellent piece of writing, and changing my life forever.

What would happen if instead of moving forward, you planted your feet squarely on the ground and refused to lose your childish purity? What if you never grew up? These are all questions which Annarasumanara asks the reader. I'd say that thematically, it is similar to the likes of Peter Pan, but that would be doing this manwha an incredible injustice. For a story all about rejecting adult life, this story is a lot more mature than the average. The story is of course, based ... around magic. Not the type you usually see in fiction, with Wizards and battles, but with the type of Magician you'd see at Carnivals or Birthday parties. The plot is ambiguous for the most part. You're never sure whether someone is telling the truth or not. Hell, you're never even sure if some of the characters are sane or not. But, this is not a negative. It's handled very well. It never makes the mistake of making something so ambiguous that the narrative becomes confusing or loses it's grounding in reality. The art is, without a doubt in my mind, the best art I've seen in a Manwha or a Manga. It's truly a joy to see people break away from normal art and do something abstract or interesting. It's clever in a way that I haven't seen in a Manwha before, where the abstraction of the work actually has tangible meaning to the plot, and isn't done just randomly out of nowhere. There are a couple of artistic quirks which I really want to talk about but I'll leave them, I don't want to spoil it.

She view things logically and carries out responsibilities, she is mature, intelligent, and quite a realist; she carries a charismatic vibe. 2- A classmate who is one of the elites in society. He is clever, logical, calculating and lives his life walking a road planned out for him. He believes education is the only prosperity to succession. 3- A magician. He abandoned luxury and society's will for the sake of his own dreams, he lives a life away from reality and has a mind as delusional as a child, he believes a dream is everything you should live for. To sum it up, a realist + an elitist + a magician, they all take you into a journey of 27 chapters, they teach you what it means to live a dream and reality, they make you see the kind of things you don't always see in mangas: originality; accuracy. Although this manga has not answered every mystery, it has taught me more than mangas with 100s of chapters did. This manga is special in its own way, all the characters seem so real and full of depth, the way every character develops is outstanding and the lessons it has taught me is unforgettable. I think after this manga, the way I carry on with my life will slightly differ than how it used to be. Reading this was a wonderful experience."}, {"score": "10", "content": "We are brought into a world where the main characters each have their own problem. Problems that are serious yet common around the world. There will be at least one point in the story, where you feel as if the story is about you. Instead of trying to create completely unique and fresh back-stories, they made relatable ones. Ones that made you think about your own life and what you want. The story really is a journey of self-discovery for us and the characters. What is that YOU want? As the chapters progress, over and over, we are taught that it is okay to be ... selfish every once in a while and no one is going to blame you for doing what you want to do. Life isn't all about pleasing others. You must pursue your own dreams even if that's not what people expect from you. Living up to each and every expectation will only make it harder to keep up. At first, the characters struggle to comprehend these concepts. They can't understand why they would do something that would only benefit them and not their parents, teachers, etc. However, they slowly come to understand that freedom is the best joy of all. The freedom to do what they desire. For their whole lives, the path to the future was cold and dark. Now, as they find things that make their heart race, they feel genuine happiness. They encounter an abundance of obstacles along the way, but they know that's a small price to pay for individualism and happiness. We see them doing whatever it takes to get on the path they deem right. No longer will they let themselves be told what they should do and shouldn't do. Even if means going against their parents and teachers, they will continue to run full steam ahead to their future, not anyone else's. The art is stunning and absolutely unique. The characters and backgrounds alike are neatly drawn. For the most part, everything is in black and white, but there are instances where there are colored drawings such as a flower or money. The flower being the sole colored drawing makes it stand out. You see that it's something beautiful in an otherwise heavy atmosphere. More often than not, the colored drawings appear to be very realistic. What's really unique about the art is how Il-Deung Na is drawn. His initial design is supposed to make you see what kind of person he is. Being the only one who's so weirdly drawn, you realize the art has a correlation with his personality. He looks that way because of how he acts. Eventually, we have fluctuations in his design as a result of him changing who he is on the inside. We have 3 main characters Lee Eul, Il-Deung Na, & Ah-ee Yoon. None of them are one-dimensional or cardboard cut-outs. They feel like actual people. Like of all us, they have their own problems and flaws. They're not perfect, but they don't come off as unlikable people. Them and their problems are so relate-able that you just can't help, but feel sympathy and care for them. Lee Eul and Ah-ee each have a substantial amount of development, but the character I really want to talk about is Il-Deung Na. I believe he goes through the most character development. In the beginning, I had nothing, but hate for this guy. Then, we got to see his problem and how he begins to change. He goes from an insufferable jerk to a jerk with problems of his own to an all around good guy. We see that even if your whole life consisted of living in darkness, it's not too late to change yourself. Il-Deung was able to realize that those who did want they wanted to do had the most fun and that having a well-paying job isn't everything. Yeah, you need to be able to take care of yourself in the future, but you also need to live your life to the fullest and not have any regrets. By noticing this, Il-Deung learns not to judge others and gives himself a future where he can support himself while smiling everyday. You know, I found out about this manhwa by checking the top-rated romance manga. I'm the type of person to drop points if the ending isn't romantically conclusive or sweet, yet I gave this manhwa a 10. Never in a million years, did I think I would be completely satisfied with a bittersweet ending. From beginning to end, the story had me in the palm of its hand. I was so into the story that I didn't even care about romance anymore. The story was just so enticing. The characters and their problems felt real to the point where it felt like I was narrating or actually listening to someone's problems. If you want a good coming-of-age story, then I highly recommend Annarasumanara."}, {"score": "6", "content": "I'm not seeing where all the hype is coming from on this one. To me, this was a forgettable manwha. Story [6/10] - I like the atmosphere of the fairground, and the main theme of holding on to childhood dreams. That's about it. Everything else was kinda cliche and forgettable. Art [4/10] - This is my least favorite part. I don't think the art is inherently bad. There were plenty of moments where the art was great, especially the flashback in chapter 25. However, during 95% of the story, we are treated with the depiction of the main character, who is drawn like a doll and has ... little to no change in facial expression throughout the entire manwha. This was just odd to me as some characters, like Il-Deung, changed expression normally. It also made it a lot harder to feel connection to the main character. The magician also didn't change much in expression, but I think that might be for a reason and at least he isn't drawn annoyingly. I will say that the cover art is great and I wish more of the art in the story was like it. Character [7/10] - Same deal with the plotline, these are just not memorable characters. Not bad, not good, just fine. However, I will +1 just because the magician was original. Enjoyment [6/10] - It was a quick read, with not an overbearing amount of text on the pages.

I felt there didn't need to be a cliffhanger but that's just my personal thought.

Particularly, Annarasumanara is scanlated by Easy Going Scans. This scan group translated many excellent works - A Fairytale of Demon Lord, Gepetto, and Paladin - to name but a few. There are also many praises about Annarasumanara. MAL reviewers typically describe this work as \"a story of miracles coming true\", “moving”, and “out of the box tale”, etc. In my opinion, though, the so-called ... originality and realism in this webtoon is belied by its lack of diversity in characters and mysterious elements of magic that the author never bothers to explain to the readers. It has been a while since I read this webtoon, so I can’t really give any solid examples out of my head. Nevertheless, this is the exact impression I got from this manhwa. The aspect that bothered me the most is the characters. Our narrator, the female protagonist, has no interesting feature, if not for her naivety. There was not one shred of coolness that emanates from the magician. He plays truant when the protagonist encounters great difficulty, reappearing again when the difficulties are resolved. Perhaps the best character in this manhwa is a character initially portrayed as a douche-bag, and that says something about the characters. Nevetheless, this manhwa has some good points. It offers an original plot line not found in any other work, a point that should be commended. Moreover, like many other Korean Webtoon, Annarasumanara has interesting art. Personally, I liked how the webtoon contains eloquent poems that set the tone for magic between the drawing panels. All in all, while a lot of MAL users really love this webtoon, I disliked it. The ending is confusing, the mood is depressing without being sentimental, though it does offer an original take on a story about magic. Quite frankly, I discontinued to believe in magic after reading this title.

But you know what's surprising? It's not snowing outside. It only snows inside this magic tent. And when the snowflakes touch the ground, they disappear without a trace. It's a little sad...” We are all bounded by endless responsibilities, expectations, insecurities and uncertainties. Being practical and working our socks off is the way to accomplish something in life that can bring money into our pockets, we are told; building castles in the air is not. Somewhere along the way of growing up, trying to live ... up to the expectations weighed down on us and being constantly advised what to do and what not, we deliberately go astray and stop chasing our dreams. How strange it is then that we find delight in trivial things which are often a medium for us to escape our monotonous life. Annarasumanara tells such a story. Yun Ai is a poor girl who struggles to feed herself and her little sister. Her goal in life is to grow up, work hard and make a decent living, and she despises irresponsibility. Her classmate, Na Il-Deung, is an example of people who are driven by the belief that being at the top means everything in life, all thanks to his parents who don’t expect anything less than hundred percent from him. When these two encounter a mysterious magician who calls himself R, things begin to change. Annarasumanara is an insightful tale; a wonderful blend of fantasy and reality. The profound effect it has on the readers owes to the fact that the characters are easily relatable. There are three individuals around whom the story revolves: Yun Ai, Na Il-Deung and R. While on the surface they are mere products of the author’s imagination to have his story centred on, yet their persona holds much more than meets the eye. As we delve into the story, we begin to see ourselves in them. We all have, at one point of time, wondered: What am I doing? Where is my life heading to? Am I living my life the right way? What do people think about me? Should I always heed what others advise me to or live my life the way I want to, try doing things differently? Is success everything that matters or is there something else in this life that holds a much greater importance? These are some of the questions that Annarasumanara attempts to explore through its characters and it succeeds in doing that in a conceivable manner. Onto the artwork now. Annarasumanara’s biggest asset is the art, no doubt. It is spectacular and unique to say the least. The use of cut-outs of real life photos and the subtle use of colour here and there are very creative indeed. The character designs are pretty good too and the facial expressions of the characters have been done well. Annarasumanara offers a visual treat and sometimes you will find yourself pausing in between to take a closer look at the subtle and beautiful visuals. To conclude, Annarasumanara is one of those works of fiction that are something ‘out of the box’ and I believe it should be given a shot irrespective of what genre you are fond of. Allow yourself to be spellbound and then ask yourself, ‘Do you believe in magic?’"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Story- Basically, 'Annara' tells the story of a young teenager which mother died and father abandoned who lives with her sister in the constant downward spiral that is life. With a lot of struggle, she must ensure money, good grades and a decent reputation all at the same time to finally find herself in a repetitious routine with no fantasy or whatsoever. From here, it's quit simplistic and we could almost think that the protagonist is, in fact, an endless Maru-sue. Yet, what makes the story (very) appreciable is for sure its incessant 'tempest of events' who are, to my past surprise, quite realistic ... (one of the greatest quality of this work, I must admit) and its variety of characters. Annara's root are maybe anchored in the deepness of the imaginative, a world who's totally mixed with ours in this Manwha, however once we understand what is the meaning of the story about, we can't help but to find any poetical meaning under each quote and action. At some times, we might find the story-line a bit repetitive - or should I say, long - since it's a real slow-paced tale, but personalty, I think this worth a try. Art- Right at the first, I fell in love. With a great mix of Manga-like art and some 'colored-cut-from-a-magazine' pictures' (I just don't know how to name this...), Annara may give the feeling of 'wasting' some chapters pages however, just like the story, it gives this feeling of 'imagination invading the reality'. The author succeeded by making metaphors with drawing and not dialogue/text and this, as much with the scenery than the characters. Unlike any Manwha or Manga, Annara do not use any screen tone (Shades of gray, shadows, patterns, etc.) but only black and white and some minor colors. Sometimes, we'll see beautiful burst of colors in important scene or even gruesome drawing made of 'colored-cut-from-a-magazine' pictures' just to put an emphasis on the element, but without beign to overwhelming, we grow to truly appreciate the art work. Once again, just like the story: it's quite simplistic, but it always finishes by impressing us. Characters- We have... the courageous, down-to-earth protagonist, the simple-minded magician, the rich brat who's oppressed by his parents' fortune and influence, the typical girls who could be considered as bully, but when we think about it, aren't really bully, but simply victim of big prejudice, the annoying parrot and... Brief, as you can see, Annara really offers a big pallet of characters. We hate them, we love them, we feels their worries. Many of the protagonist's passage with her 'letter to mother' gave us the feeling of 'being into the story' and thus, make us able to fully plunge into the deepness of this sea of feelings. Overall- Definitely recommended! There is romance in this story, but gladly, to my point of view: it is not the center of the plot. So as much the girls as the boys can read it and if you're not a fan of smushy gooshy love, once again: this is for you. Actually, I could even say that instead of giving to protagonist the goal of making a boyfriend, we tried to make us believe in something that we lost a long ago though the basic of a story. I truly enjoyed this piece of work and trust me: it worth the time. So everyone... I am asking you this question: do you believe in magic?"}, {"score": "10", "content": "(I've never written a review before but I just loved this webtoon so much I felt that I needed to.) Story- Although the plot itself isn't incredibly interesting or original, the execution really brings the story together. It has a slice of life/school life vibe thats integrated into a alice in wonderland-type of fantasy. There's also a lot of symbolism (which I love!) that adds another layer to the story. Art- Breathtaking. Seriously. Most of the images are in black and white (which is rare for a webtoon) but there are occasional parts with color. The art is always spot on. The backgrounds always have interesting angles ... and details, and the characters' expressions are always spot on. It's gorgeous. Note:Some people have a problem with one of the character's bizarrely long hotdog head that no one in the webtoon seems to notice, but its meant to be a symbol of the character's ego. As an outsider looking into the story, the reader is the only one who can see the character's true personality. (It's similar to Oyasumi Punpun where the main character is portrayed as a bird when he is actually a human in the story) Character- I believe in every character. They seem so real that I have no doubt that every character has their own life that goes on even when I'm not reading about them. I associate with a little piece of every character from the carefree yet endearing sister to the childish and idealistic father to the grade grabbing classmate with a wiener head (see note above). But most importantly, Yoon Ai is a fantastic heroine. While she tends to silently suffer, she is definitely not weak. Unlike a lot of unrealistically happy-go-lucky heroines with financial problems, Yoon Ai is jaded. I appreciate the fact that when the magician appears with his magic tricks (an escape from the real world), she rejects them, knowing she has a duty to her family. She can't just be whisked away by a prince. She, like the rest of us, has responsibilities. Of course, that doesn't mean that she can't find a balance between the two! Overall: I would recommend this to anyone. Boy or girl. Young or old. It's realistic, relatable, heartbreaking, incredibly funny, and just magical."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Simply... breathtaking. When I had first noticed this, I thought nothing much of it, until I actually read it. The story was really fascinating, intriguing me to read the next chapter. I enjoyed the story, encouraging even adults to have a dream, a goal, and have fun in this life. The art was absolutely beautiful, and I loved the occasional abstract arts with color input. The characters were enjoyable as well, and the author drew some with their personalities, and I had only later found of it around the end of the story. Why by the end of the manga, a few tears had fallen ... from my eyes as I read. This story is very powerful, and strong, letting people know that it is okay to hold on to some dreams from when we were children, and try to find our \"bed of flowers\". Overall, it is certainly one of my most favorite manga I had ever read, with the beautiful story, and plot, and the conclusion was absolutely mysterious, and unique, leaving people think of what they read in words printed on the pages."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Day to day our society is becoming more realistic, more competitive & our lives are becoming more and more structured, directed toward a certain goal. To prosper in this world there is quite often no room for what one want's but almost always our path is focused towards what we need to do to be a respectable member of the community. In this modernized viewpoint there is no room for someone who does not want to grow up, children are forced to build up their life focused towards being a successful professional, whether they want to be that or not. Annarasumanara is the story of ... someone deciding to not grow up, its the story of never forgetting or giving up one's dream, the story of what this pressure can do to someone & the story of the beauty of magic in its many forms in our modern society. Story This is where this Manhwa truly shows the authors real talent, he somehow uses an all too realistic and tragic setting of a struggling high school girl, of her hardships to support herself and her little sister through school while also struggling with the choice between her dream and reality. At first its her straightforward desire to soon become an adult, but then a magician who claims to be a real one somehow enters into her life and tries to remind her of her innocent childhood, reminds her of her memories and dreams. But the hard reality never lets her go and the story goes forward through her experiences and realizations in quite a satisfying pace. That's about all I can give without spoilers but I can also say that the progression and the execution is quite flawless in this short piece. Although some might disagree with me on this point but for me the story is the strongest point of this Manhwa it deserves a 9.5 out of 10. Art Some might say this is the best part of the Manhwa. This is in full color & frankly the art is visually mesmerizing. There are pages without words which say a lot of things through the beauty of the art, the facial expressions portray the emotions exquisitely, the background is also very detailed and has the unique ability to draw attention to the stunning bits of details. If not for the brilliance of story surely the art would have been the best thing here, and it does manage to hold on its own quite pleasingly. It gets 9 out of 10 from me. Characters There are only three main characters, the main girl Ah-ee whose development through her encounter with the mysterious yet childish magician is the main story. Ah-ee is someone who is put in such a unfavorable situation from the first, with no parents with her she has to work on part time jobs & deal with debt collectors looking for her dad while looking after her younger sister and keeping her in school too. Yet comes the magician who tells her that someone should do as many things as they want as they do things that they don't want or have to do. The magician is a character who does not really go thorough development in a sense but the more appropriate word would be unveiled in a artistic way by the author. And it is really hard to not be puzzled by him or not to like him. Then there is the character of Il-deung who seems to have everything, seems to be on the right track to reach his goal, yet there is something lacking. His interaction with Ah-ee then his introduction to the magician & how he is influenced by his ways is like another part of the same story or like another side of the coin. The side characters do not really get that much time or space in the story due to the short length but author still somehow manages to present them in quite a palatable and pleasant way. The characters get 9 out of 10 from me. Enjoyment As for enjoyment, in between all the long and dragged stories out there this short yet memorable Manhwa is something I really enjoyed. Despite its size the pacing was very adequate and the story progression never felt rushed at all. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a nice story, beautiful art or is simply tired of reading/waiting for those long winded series' out there, believe me you wont be disappointed. Overall Score - 9 out of 10."}, {"score": "10", "content": "STORY: 9 Without giving away the full plot, the theme of Annarasumanara is childhood vs. adulthood; a reality that ever child has to grow one day to face the hash cruel world of adulthood. This can be terrifying or thrilling. It is a very unique subject to tackle, but the author did an interesting job, while incorporates a touch of \"magic\" of his/her own. The flow and pace of the story is somewhat slow, but builds up in a poetic way. ART: 10 Art style is beautiful and distinguishable--pretty much the highlight of Annarasumanara. It is a great mix of Manga-like art and some 'coloured-cut-from-a-magazine' pictures.' Whenever ... the illustrator incorporates colour, it obvious stands out from the bleak black and white world of Annarasumanara. Actually, the art pretty much can tell the story and words alone are not necessary. CHARACTER: 9 Background of each character is realistic and convincing. The main characters are a poor but down-to-earth girl, a child-like man who live in a world of \"magic\", and a rich-boy oppressed by his parent's expectation. The other support characters aren't as distinguishable as them, but move the story along well enough. No one is annoying, rather instead brings life to Annarasumanara. ENJOYMENT: 10 I personally enjoy Annarasumanara. Story and art incorporated together in a meaningful way. It wonderfully tied together in the end. OVERALL: 9.5 (round up to 10) I would recommend to anyone who enjoys pondering meaningful message behind a story. Also, something different and appealing to the eyes is a plus too.

With her mom out of the picture and her dad on the run from loan sharks Ah-ee is very much alone. One day while chasing down money that was in her possession she runs into a strange man who claims to be a real magician. From there on Ah-ee's ... life changes. Essentially, Annarasumanara not only puts a spotlight on Ah-ee but two other characters,: Ah-ee's classmate, Il-Deung and how he lives a one track life of nothing but his studies and the mysterious magician himself. Annarasumanara is well woven reality check of the \"grown up world\" so to speak and how each of the characters handles the emotional tethers of life's struggles and the rather harsh reality of growing up in the real world almost without any belief of magic or hopes for the future. I can say the most commented and praised detail about this story would have to be the art style and how it captured the mood of the story making it seem a bit darker than it was made to be while making a few appropriate stops to add color and brightness to the pages as if to say \"even in the deepest, darkest pits of despair and disbelief if you make the magic a reality you can light the path to your future.\" Overall i'm very happy I ran into this title because it gave me a very important lesson on life and how you yourself believe in magic then you can use it to break your own physical and emotional tethers."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Guys, this is manhwa which love in himself the reader from the first Chapter.

It is impossible not to smile, looking at him! :) I could only read adequately and thoughtfully this masterpiece from the second time, when I hammered on this dude-sausage.

I can't think about something, expect this work. As if on the heels of walks magician who will help and protect. By the way, it is well! It adds confidence in your abilities and undertakings :) Magic doing something unimaginable. You understand that all together develop in something greater than an invention.

So - \"Do you believe in magic?\" :)"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Do you believe in magic? This manhwa is truly a splendid package of entertainment, perseverance, and beauty. Children tend to believe magic easily as they perceive it as something amazing. Once they grow up, they start realizing how silly they were for thinking that. Believing in yourself, and trying not to fit into the typical \"stereotype,\" is pretty much the main moral/theme of this wonderful manwha. Story: A cursed child who has to work day and night simply to pay off the debts of her father, and to pretty much survive through the darkness of life. Her name is Ai meaning \"child,\" ... in Korean. She works hard, also trying to care for her little sister. Sooner or later, she meets the person who truly causes her life to take a toll. Not only in a negative way, but also in a wonderful way. Together, they go through the adventures of \"magic,\" along with Il-Deung who conveys affection towards Ai throughout the story. The magician was somewhat infamous outside of his little tent, but he never let society lead his way. He stayed true to who he was, and what he wanted. That's exactly what Ai, and Il-Deung did with their lives, except they continued to pursue their education but with a hint of fun. Art: Let me tell you something about the art of this manwha. So far, this manwhaga's art is the best I've ever seen in any comic book ALIVE The art is just extremely creative! The detailed parts, the shaded times, the illusional moments, they all take you to a different world! As you're observing this manwhaga's art, you're being sucked into a portal which leads to your perfect world! The world where you're calm, and happy not facing any stress or annoyance. Not worrying what others care about you. You're just sitting there calmly enjoying the beauty and truth of the manwhaga's art. Character: The character development was certainly beyond amazing. It's ironic to say this, but each character had chemistry! Even the enemies in this story were quite enjoyable! Usually the ominous characters tend to be quite annoying, but in this manwha they weren't that infuriating! For a manwhaga to create something like that, that definitely takes a lot of talent. I thought Ai, and the magician aka \"Lee,\" had tons of good chemistry! *Spoiler Alert* The cutest moment in this manhwa that enables you to realize that Ai is the perfect female protagonist that I've ever seen in a shoujo series before is when she's displayed to be quite jealous but in a cute way. You see a pregnant woman (companion of Lee in school) who comes to visit Lee in the aloof amusement park; Ai of course sees her, and postulates start entering her mind. She starts assuming that she might be his wife, or something. As she's hiding behind the tent, she convinces herself that none of this involves her, and she continues to move on with her life until the moment of truth strikes her, and she decides to go back and check the incident out. Quite cute, don't you think! I thought Lee was extremely bizarre, yet tender. Overall, the characters were just tremendous. Enjoyment: I can't begin to describe how much I've enjoyed this manwha! It's amazing! Nothing else to be mentioned! YOU MUST READ THIS MANWHA. The art was magnificent. The plot is very realistic yet creative. It's the enjoyment of this manwha that will make you read the story within seconds. The pages will pass very quickly as the life span of a typical human being.

Thank you!"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Well, this story leaves a lot to the imagination so i think every individual will perceive it in their own way. But here is mine. Why i liked this manhwa and why it is a genius. The story is very straightforward and simple yet touches deep. And what i find really genius about this manhwa is how it has nothing related with supernatural. At the beginning of the story, i was skeptical. Thinking \"magic does not exist, it is just a trick\" drawing a fine line between reality and magic. Yet, the story just blurs that line. No matter how realistic you may be, you will find ... yourself wanting to believe in this magic. The magic makes your hearth flutter. It is colorful, it is bright. It almost makes you believe that it is real. And what i absolutely love about this story is, it makes you believe in magic but then it hits you in the gut with harsh reality. The reality is \"inescapable\". You struggle to survive, it is full of hardships, and sometimes it overwhelms. Some chooses the magic as a scapegoat. But this story tells you to embrace the hardships, cope with it, and move on. And it also tells \"Magic is real. You just need to believe\". Yeah, \"how convenient\" i know. But if you really think about it, isn't it simple? As long as you believe, it will never cease to exist. It might ask you to blindly believe in it, such thing, only possible for an innocent mind. Finally the story comes to the conclusion, where it asks you if you believe in magic. And you can guess what my answer was."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Reading the first chapters, I thought that this was a fantasy type manga, with the story revolving about a *real magician* and how would he make a dramatical change in a life of a very poor woman. Indeed, the story was very unique and well-thought of. What was great about the art is that it was perfectly made that it totally blended with the story being under the *mystery* genre. I found it to be quite odd at some point but have gotten grown fonder with it somehow. To make it totally short, it is a story about realizing your true dreams, what you would do ... to achieve it, and what will you do afterwards. The manga is a must-read masterpiece in its own weird way that will surely drag you in the magical world of wonders, leaving you with the one single question. . . Do you believe in magic????"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Annarasumanara is a stunning manhwa that deals with themes such as growing up and social expectation. First and foremost, the art is phenomenal. The simple colouring in this manhwa is used perfectly to convey emotion without being over-bearing. Also, the art style itself can only be described as unique. Throughout the manhwa, strange imagery is used, but it portrays the message very well. Plot-wise, this manhwa is not fast-paced whatsoever. The story unfolds leisurely, but it's not done so in a way that is irritating or boring. However, if you're looking for something full of action, this may not be for you. Instead, Annarasumanara uses intrigue ... as it's main plot-device, keeping the reader interested throughout, but revealing the story and characters slowly. If you're looking for a quick read with beautiful art that truly makes you think, then Annarasumanara would definitely be worth your time."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Annarasumanara is a healing manhwa. It broadens your outlook on life with adversities that people face especially with the compromises they make when they grow older. It's a manhwa that allows you to have a chance to reflect back on yourself, check whether you are who you are and not someone that the world expects you to be or the world forces you to be. In a way we don't necessarily journey through life but life sort of forces itself on us. We change to fit the world as we grow. It's difficult to hold onto your dreams when reality says otherwise. The manhwa ... addresses these questions with a easy to follow story that's laden with symbolisms. It's fun to go through understanding what the author is trying to say with some of the symbolisms. The art is easy on the eye and very unique to fit the dark atmosphere that suits the very personal and serious questions it asks. The characters do grow through the series as they ask themselves the same questions that asks the reader and to be honest they are very relatable. I could even say that I have met all the characters whether bad or good at one point in my life because that's how relatable and believable they were. You can really tell that the author wanted to send a message to its readers and I can't find a single flaw as this story delivers that message superbly."}, {"score": "10", "content": "This read was, for better words, truly unexpected. A lot of people went into this like myself, intrigued, confused. There are about 50 reviews of this mahnwa on this website as of now and most of them are positive. So it begs the question, why does it have such high ratings? Everyone talks about how this was a beautifully written mahnwa, how it changed their perspective on life, how they enjoyed the art, the implications of the ending … You should read some of the reviews cause they are beautifully written and in my opinion also inspiring. The story starts like this: “Do you believe in magic?” This is ... how this mahnwa actually starts. With a question of all things. Very bold of an author to do this, because you have to sell it when it comes to the end or it’s not gonna work. Some people who didn’t like all the questions that came with the mahnwa, but I believe this was the point of the story. To see who would believe. Because that was the point of Annarasumanara. It’s done quite remarkably. This isn’t just a story made to inspire teenagers/young adults. This was a story made to inspire everyone, from all genders, to all ages, to all backgrounds. In 27 chapters this mahnwa encompasses everything that it means to be or become an adult. The biggest plot point is about dreams, but I find that this is more of a camouflage to the underlining plot point in this incredibly written mahnwa, and that is aspirations. What do you aspire to be when you get old? And if you have gotten to a certain age, is that what you have always aspired to be growing up? I feel like 27 chapters weren’t enough but that’s just cause I loved the end to this story.

Anyone who thinks comics do not count as real literature should think twice after reading this. The story is throughly impactful and there is a very clear overall message as well as many symbolisms. The artstyle is very simplistic yet detailed, much like how many modern comics are drawn. Usually I read webtoons for the color but the minimalistic usage of color in this manga really makes what is important pop. I love how Il and his parents are drawn in that certain way and then much ... later is Il finally drawn \"normally\". I believe it symbolizes the prideful, confident, and superior feeling they get for being top tier and model adults, like a sort of proud with a long face, not in a sad way (but maybe so actually), more in a way like political cartoons. Speaking of him lets get into the characters, i dont feel that the main girl developed as much as i would have liked and the magician was trippy character however there definitely was develope,ent within the two.

In the middle of this dilemma, I stumbled onto this manhwa again, it had been in my list for a while, I wonder why I never got around to reading it, even though it's only 27 chapters long.

But are you truly living? The art is remarkable, and while the story itself doesn't have complicated so people might argue why I am considering this a masterpiece. Well, you see. This story shines in its simplicity. It seems like it is romanticized but it's not. It introduces fresh perspectives and makes us see the beauty in something as underrated as the art of magic. I loved the metaphors they used in the dialogues. Honestly, I loved everything about it. It's the perfect story to binge read on a fresh yet chilly night, and I am so glad that I read it today.

I've never been so enchanted by any manga or manhwa, like this before. Annarasumanara is truly a masterpiece.

However one cannot help but feel dazzled by the enthralling art. The modern surrealism enraptures you in a state of self-reflection and amplifies the delight of ... the reading.

It seemed to be pulled out of a different style of art. But I guess that is to add to the emphasis on some areas. Some of the characters are a bit exaggerated as you ... will see when you read them.

I don’t mean that in the sense that it is a Manhwa, it does far more than just ‘being a manhwa’. Despite this claim, the story, or at least the setup for Annarasumanara isn’t anything particularly special, a girl living in poverty, tragedy and harsh reality. It’s a great way to make people empathize and root for a character, when it’s done well; and in this case, it is! Annarasumanara stands out not in its story and plot. ... The story is good and it carries a valuable message about life and society. That isn’t why Annarasumanara is as good as it is. It’s all in the art and the visuals. Speaking of, the visuals are simply amazing. They are so original, they blend so many styles and incorporate so many techniques that throw the ‘draw on paper and scan it’ standard out the window. It’s just breathtakingly original and different. Just scrolling down that first chapter (Manhwa format) is like the best thing since sliced bread. Collage, panorama, patterns, photos, heavy contrast, good grayscale, landscape arranged in portrait it’s just an amalgam, and It just works™. I mean the guy even used LEGOs, like excuse what, and he made it work! Back on topic, the art isn’t the only thing compelling about this work, the characters are very interesting, in that they are used to great length by the author to explore universal ideas and challenges that people face. Each of our three main characters suffer from very bad cases of misfortune, and all three feel stuck. Yoon Ah-ee is stuck in poverty, Euh Lee is stuck in the child-like wonder of the past and Il-Deung Na is stuck on a predetermined path. All of them are great, they aren’t one-dimensional sheets with no discernible personality. I personally found myself easily having empathy and sympathy for them. I really enjoyed reading this manga, it’s a treat on a visual level, and the story and characters are very engaging and well made.

As kids, we would often harbor pure and naive desires to want to be like those in the fantasies but through the vicissitudes of growing up, inevitably sealed those elusive thoughts away. As we matured, we rationalized that certain things are simply unachievable and unrealistic. We couldn't fly and save people like Superman; we couldn't be like Peter Pan who will never grow up, nor was there any Neverland in our world. We didn't have powers. And that magic is not real. Some point in our life we became adults and started prioritizing more earthly, materialistic wants. In order to ... conform to society's expectations, in order to 'live'; gone were those innocent wishes of the past. But what about those who couldn't abandon them and still clings onto the hope to be something they couldn't possibly become? What about those who are conflicted in-between? In this manhwa titled Annarasumanara, we get a glimpse into said characters with those struggles in all of its unforced candor. A thought-provoking and touching story told earnestly and devoid of unnecessary contrived plot devices. A truly wonderful read. As it'll be a shame to spoil anything for future readers, I will not discuss about the story or its cast. Instead, I want to divert your attention to the visuals. Just take a look at the first few pages. It's hardly surprising how this manhwa has the ability to grip its reader from the onset. Any decent writer can tackle a story about magic and life but are they able to embellish it with jaw-dropping illustrations? This aesthetic aspect is what I feel makes Annarasumanara so mesmerizing and a cut above the rest. After all, humans are naturally attracted to beautiful things. Annarasumanara does not only tugs our heartstrings with its beautifully-woven tale but also possesses the gorgeous arts to complement with its mystical atmosphere, making for a truly immersive and surreal experience. It is no wonder how easily us readers could be so captivated in the fanciful flights of this manhwa when you have such enchanting visuals graced upon you. \"Do you believe in magic?\" You know, there is a dreamer in us all. A purity deep down that wants to believe that magical things do exist. Just like our characters in the story. I wish I could better express how special Annarasumanara is but the right words just don't seem to flow through from my incompetent self. It saddens me how such a beautiful manhwa isn't that particularly well-known and there's nothing much I could about it.

So I found this manga because I am Sean the magical weeaboo (I am a weeaboo magician) And I was curious if I could find any manga about magic tricks, sleight of hand, magicians or anything along those lines. What I eventually found was this one right here. At first I was skeptical, I thought there was a possibility it might end up being really cheesy due to my past experiences with magicians in manga. I decided to ... give it a try however, because of both the high score, and my curiosity. I was not disappointed. Annarasumanara is a drama series that touches upon topics many of us can personally relate to and uses magic elements to create a mysterious atmosphere to go with it. What this story tackles the best is the whole concept of people growing up and giving up on their dreams mainly because they believe their dreams are childish, and they feel like they need to move forward. If this intrigues you in any way, you must read this manga because the entire manga is basically this premise but in a extremely well developed format. The way it was put together is done in a way where you can really get inside their head. I guess the best way I can put this is the emotion felt real. So now onto the second reason why this manga is so good. The art. This is some of the most creative and cool looking art I have ever seen used in manga. If you have ever read goodnight pun-pun, I guess you could use that as a example of what the art is similar to. Some parts look absolutely beautiful, while others look really interesting and abstract. Let's just let it be known, the visuals are absolutely amazing. And finally, the atmosphere. If you like mysterious feeling stories, this is a manga for you to look into. I wouldn't classify this book as a mystery, but it defiantly has some of those aspects. Overall, if you want to read a really good book about magicians with relatable emotions and insane visuals you should check this out. As a magician who has seen many fictional stories revolving around magic tricks, illusion, sleight of hand, etc, I would probably say this is the best one. 8/10"}, {"score": "8", "content": "TL;DR: A short, but effective story, it had great themes and characters that were also executed pretty nicely, the only reason why I can't give it more than an 8 is the lack of impact it had on me (seeing as I'm already aware of everything that is tackled in this story) and it's lack of complexity, more chapters and time for character development could only help this story and it's characters and themes. Damn, this hit all the right spots when it comes to it's themes, at least for me. Societal expectations, \"rotten adults\" (Persona 5 players get it), the importance of keeping your childhood ... innocence. Hell, even one of the best ones, anti-escapism (learning to face reality, the opposite of isekai's). While I only tipped my toes in the manhwa form of comics, it sure has quite some good ones (like Dr. Frost and Bastard (here, as far as I can remember) ). And this one earned its spot as one of my favorite manhwa's, that's for sure. What I should get out of the way at first though, the questionable decision to add a \"romance\" tag, since this manhwa barely has any and it's almost pointless to the plot,themes and maybe it was fine just for a character's development, but it's still not a main focus and it's not that relevant. For someone who wasn't in the mood for it while reading it, I was satisfied with what I got in terms of it's romance though. It was a short, but nice paced read that I finished in 2 or 3 hours and I believe I got plenty of value from it, judging by its length. Now on with the review itself. Artstyle It is almost like a manga in terms of the color palets, it's mostly in black and white, with some hints of color here and there, but it's almost inexistent, so it wasn't hard to get into it. There are also some photorealistic images used in some cases, which, while they are uncanny and goofy, were an interesting artistic decision which I welcomed with open arms, since they aren't common. There is also a case of Punpun drawing, where a character is drawn different then how he looks in reality, which you can kind of figure out when it is stated in the beginning that people around him think he is handsome. It was also a bit unexpected that this style decision was addressed latter in the story, which, if it was forshadowing, it's greatly appreciated, and if it was a last moment decision, it was still alright, since we can't know which is the case, although I feel it was the former. No complaints about the artstyle, I believe the wacky artistic decisions and even the manhwa style of panneling were fitting in context of the story, characters , dialogue and themes, since these decisions are in relation to important aspects of this manhwa's world. Story A girl meets a magician that makes her remember the passion that she had when she was little for magic. What stays in her way though is the fact that she is extremely poor, has debts to pay and in order to do that, she tries to mature as fast as possible in order to make a living. Then there is the magician itself who is quite a mystery, he is really eerie, especially in the beginning, and the story focuses on learning more about him, gradually replacing the eerines with humanity. The last of the main characters is long head dude, we see how he deals with the perfectionism that has he in order to please his parents and to secure his future. While it was a short story, all of them got to shine and had plenty of time for living as characters, developing and for having a satisfying end to each of their respective arcs. Characters Well, you have the usual nice but timid girl that doesn't socialise, but not for some unfounded reason, as it so often happens in other cases, but because she is focused on academic performance in order to secure a good and safe future and to make money, seeing as she really is in need of it in order to live with her younger sister. What was to be appreciated is that, while she isn't really talkative, she still didn't seem to have any problems communicating with the other 2 main characters, so it looks more like a choice to focus on other aspects of life rather than her being socially awkward. Her goals were also well established, earning money even if she has to sell her dignity and pride, she chooses to sacrifice her innocence, time, money, youth, joviality for her sister, and to a lesser extent, also for her. There is also an interesting conflict between her desire to become more mature (so the aspects I just talked about) and the rekindling of her childhood dream to become a magician with the help of her new magician friend, highlighting the importance of finding and keeping your \"inner child\", as some psychologists may put it. While I am not a big fan of anime girls and maybe even some manga girls due to the way they are portrayed, usually pretty one or two dimensional and by representing the usual stereotypes, this one is a good addition in my small collection of enjoyable and respectable characters with whom I can empathize, that I can understand and care about, because she is portrayed in a humane way. Then there is the magician. While, at first, even his existence can be doubted, seeing as how strange of a presence he has, he gradually becomes more humane as we see more of his interactions with other characters, hints of a past, rumors and even flaws. While the main girl tries to get away from her childhood and become an adult, the magician instead tries to avoid adult responsibilities and remain a child. What makes her change is the influence of the magician, while what makes him change is the current and past problems that come back to ruin the bubble that he lives in, as an adult that can play all day with magic like a kid, both of them ending up supporting and helping each other grow and face reality, where the anti-escapism aspects come to light. His character development was something that I wasn't really expecting, I thought he would be more like a plot device that helps the main girl change for the better, but he became a character in his own right. Not only I didn't expect it, but the direction his character went in was also quite unique, especially in execution. All in all, a very satisfying and intriguing character, the only personal problem that I have with him is the ambiguity when it comes to the existence of his powers, although the answer probably can be brought down to \"it doesn't matter\" because it doesn't matter if the power exists or not, only that it captures the innocence and gullibility of children, which we should also accept in our own lives, in a healthy amount. Despite that, I would have enjoyed a clearer ending to him, but that's just my opinion, I still greatly appreciate his character though and this doesn't take it away from him. And the last main character, long head dude. Not gonna lie, at first, I thought he was a secondary character and perhaps that was how it was made to look because we still had to be introduced to the other main characters I just talked about, but it was still necessary to establish him as a character and it was a good choice to connect him mainly to our main character, but to then differentiate them in the second half of the story, because we get to learn about both of them by using their interactions, efficiently using the little time that the story has to establish 2/3 main characters with ease and with creating an interesting dynamic between the two, since they both strive for academic perfectionism, yet they come from different worlds (the protag is poor, while he comes from a rich family). He goes through quite the internal conflict and changes, which, once again, while they were not expected to this extent, they were well executed; he had the time to establish himself and to be made understood in the first half, so when the story starts to focus on him more, you begin to empathize with his struggles even more and want to see how he deals with them. It takes a bit for him to really shine and show his true potential, but when that time comes, I believe he shines the brightest and by the end of it, I love his character (and character development) the most. And that ain't easy with an already great duo of MC's and themes that they represent, but it all comes down to taste and personal experience/values. Long head is used to highlight the youth who try to find their real self in a world that already has plans for them and has to become what's expected from them without question, like slaves. Can't complain here. All 3 of them are focused character with their distinct personalities, traits, values, morals, backgrounds, problems, doubts, dreams and thematic relevance. While they may all seem different, what all of them have in common is their perspective as to what being an adult means and how they should become one, so the author clearly knew what he was doing in term of the direction of the character development. The fact that all 3 of the main characters shine in their own rights and the appreciation of their character writing all comes down to personal taste and how close you can relate to any of the themes is quite impressive and takes a high level of skill to accomplish in such a short time (in terms of the manhwa's length) with this good of an execution. Themes \"Keeping your childhood dream\" (or rather, your childhood self, to some extent). While the story focuses on the dreams aspects of childhood, the message in itself is about not forsaking your immaturity, innocence and playfulness, for the sake of some emotionally detached maturity that focuses on rationality, logic, income and societal status. This theme works very well in societies where maturity at any cost is the main focus of the respective population, since their own humanity is stolen from them and is replaced with slavery to money, society and government. I guess you could say that this is the case everywhere, only to to different degrees, so it's a universally important and relatable theme. To be of note here is also the traumatized children (both the real children and adults who still carry their traumas) that believe they need to become more mature, to stop expressing their emotions, that they aren't natural or needed. I guess you could say that for these kinds of people, this is the only way they learn how to survive and I can't take it from them. But what should be taken into consideration is that the lack of balance between maturity and childlike traits, going in either extremes, isn't something we should live with and simply accept. As someone who's seen and been on both sides, being a child forever just makes it harder to face hardships that are everpresent these days, with the societal and academic expectations that constantly rise and being all mature and detached from emotions can only take you so far before breaking down, and even if you can live with that, it's still a sad life not much worth living, whether these people can see it or not. Although, in the end, I guess it's not really a choice, it's just something that happens, so can't blame anyone for the type of life they live. Despite all that, first, there were feelings, then there were words and thoughts, so no matter how much people try to ignore their childlike traits, behavior and feelings, they are still alive and part of them. And this manhwa shows how abandoning your childhood dream only leads to misery, as can be seen by the protagonist's father, but also the girl herself, and I believe it was beautifully and realistically portrayed in this case. On the opposite spectrum, we can see how living in a constant childlike state can be a sign of immaturity and incapacity of growing up,which leads to the dangers of these dreams as portrayed with the help of the magician, who is incapable of adapting to society and instead runs from his responsibilities in order to pursue his childhood dream. He helps balance the way the theme is shown by not overromanticizing it, but showing both sides of the argument, which leads to a realistic depiction of what living with and without important aspects of your childhood lead to. So yea, the takeaway here is that, while you should still grow up, have some responsibilities, and try to adapt to society, you should still try to keep a part of your childhood alive, in some contexts, since not only it is something natural for us, to a certain extent, but it's a show of maturity in it's own right, since not everyone can easily balance a life where he can behave both like an adult and like a child, depending on the context that they are in and this manhwa shows both perspectives in a simple but believable way (whether it's effective all depends on your personal experience, so I can't guarantee it). Since I was just talking about the magician, I also have to bring up the \"anti-escapism\" aspects of his character arc. While he wants to stay and act like a child forever, reality catches up to him, leading to his own conflict, which I believe is really easy to predict in terms of the direction his character takes, without the particular details regarding his life. Still, it's highly appreciated to see a story that doesn't go for the whole \"this world sucks, let's go to a fantasy one\" trope, but instead shows you how 3 characters try to become stable adults that try to face their realities that aren't by any means easy, fair and enjoyable quite often. I won't go in the direction of \"escapism is bad\", seeing as, even if everyone indulges in some sort of escapism in it's life, including myself, it is still a way to relax from all the negativity and shitty life circumstances that we have to grow up in and live. What I will argue about, though, is the importance of having more stories that encourage self-reflection, making your life better and taking it in your own hands, seeing as what usually gets adapted into anime is escapism stories. Having more motivating, but realistic stories will probably never be too many or get too old. Escapism can be good, but anti-escapism is the best (especially when it comes to the themes it can tackle). \"Rotten adults\" (or if you prefer a fancier and more boring way of describing this theme, \"the societal and academic expectations that adults (parents) put on their children). As I previously mentioned, this is shown with the help of long neck dude whose parents put pressure on him to earn perfect scores in all exams. Just like irl, in some places more or less, there is always pressure from the adults to \"become someone”, to have a good paid job, to be an adapted member of society (slave) and to always follow what others deem \"good” for you, instead of listening to your own feelings, instincts and thoughts (which, to be fair, with how traumatized people are these days, it's probably for the better). Despite all that, some people, once they find themselves interested in their own independence, self-discovery and the truth, it's pretty hard (if not almost impossible) to stop this process, which inevitably make you question your decisions, your family, friends, adults in general, your future and the path that you should follow. And, of course, this story shows how choosing to live free from the chains that adults put around your neck is better than living like a dog of society, even if the path will have it's own hardships, it's still better to be free and struggle than to be an obedient slave. If you are familiar with this theme and how it usually plays out in anime/manga/games, this isn't an exception, but it's executed nicely and it's definitely welcome, as long as the author understands it and how to execute it in a story format (which he does). While I mainly have only good things to say about the themes, my main gripe with them is that they don't have enough complexity and longevity, seeing as the story doesn't have a lot of chapters and I believe it's a shame, because the themes and characters have a lot of potential and can only benefit from having more time to be developed and highlighted. Conclusion There ain't anything left to say, it was a very short, but focused manhwa that knew what it wanted to do from the beginning and executed it to a high degree in the small amount of time that it had. Seeing as my reviews are actually quite long, compared to what I usually see on this site, I should probably end this by thanking everyone that reads until the end, even if you do or don't like what I write (or myself and my taste, seeing as some people probably hate me only because of that).

I'm not even sure what this means, probably the author's own spin on the ol' \"abracadabra\" but it grew on me after its repeated use in each chapter. The story of a girl struggling to survive amidst poverty is not an original plot for a manga or manhwa. However, with the introduction of the magician, the story becomes surreal. I wasn't even sure what to believe or even what was going on until the last chapters of the series. Overall very short but incredibly thought-provoking and though I did not cry, the feeling was definitely there. It was ... almost personal for me as I have had parallel thoughts to both what L and Ai believed: the conflict between securing social and financial security or pursuing your passion. The art in this tiny 27 chapter series is stunning. The art style is very sketchy (in the sense of rough-draft and not suspicious) and the use of thin lines gives the whole story this delicate aura; most characters (Ai and L) are beautiful. Evidently, there is a dark, monotonous palette that lends the eerie vibe of some indie horror game or dystopian wasteland occasionally contrasted with a splash of color. The use of color in a gray background really does wonders for emphasis and the author's use of real life images, backgrounds, as well as some homestyle paper animation made me feel like the entire series was some sort of art piece. You can tell from the variety of art mediums and detail of drawing the amount of work and effort that was put into making this series. Each and every component has purpose and meaning. Ai's character really clicked with me. Not unlike other manga heroines, Ai is smart, hard-working, and responsible, having had to pull up the remnants of her family by the bootstraps. But I find she's also a lot more realistically portrayed and three-dimensional than your typical shoujo lead, something the author does fantastically well with the other characters as well. She struggles, she feels resentment, she is flawed (though if I'm honest, not by much. Most of her faults lie in her family's state of poverty.) L, the star of the show, is also another amazing character. Something about him, so whimsical, random, mysterious, immediately draws you into the story. I was quite confused about his character initially, wasn't even sure if he existed or not in the beginning, but he gets his own explanation towards the end. I do wish that his character consisted of more than just the dude who does magic throughout the story; it seemed as if we didn't see his entire personality until the conclusion. And then Il-Deung. What was up with his head, right? I think the author did a great job with his character development especially in the short amount of content she had, I turned out to really like his character in the end. For the other characters--rather typical; they fit quite neatly into those character tropes you always see in manga. Clearly, the MCs were given the most attention. Ultimately, it boils down to this: I wanted a quick read and chose this relatively short series that exceeded expectations. Annarasumanara, though not perfect, is definitely one of those obscure manga that deserves higher praise and more coverage. Surreal is the word I would use to describe it and I honestly regret not giving this series the full attention it deserves (if I had, there would've been tears I'm sure). Read this if you want something different, something kinda sad, or something that makes you think!"}, {"score": "6", "content": "Graced by a cute art style that expresses the manhwa’s childish overview, Annarasumanara is about all the magic we miss once we grow up into what we consider an adult. This definition is one that’s usually coined by society, but it’s completely left our interpretation. Yet we’re hardly given control of how we truly want to maneuver ourselves during the challenges of our present and the catastrophes of our past: one where we leave behind everything that was important to us to live a real life. Following the steps of Ah-ee Yoon, Annarasumanara explores what it means to believe and perform magic. Ah-ee finds herself lost ... in her school life, but she wants something more than just grades and money. She’s burdened with the game of numbers, but all that starts to change when she meets the magician called Eui Lee who is a so-called real magician. At the forefront, this is a romantic slice of life with multiple hidden meanings layered between the nuanced approaches to presenting us with what it means to live a mundane life while realizing that we can either complain or create our own memory lane. There’s an opportunity cost and consequence to all our actions, and sometimes the most obvious ones cause us the most turmoil. We’re so hard-wired into believing that we have to live one way or another, that strangers always bring dangers, and that money is the most important aspect of life. Annarasumanara plays judge, jury, and executioner to each of those topics through its three central players. For a large part of this short series, Ah-ee confronts the idea of whether Eui Lee is actually a real magician or if everything is a trick and she just wants to believe in it because of the magic she never chased as a child. Yet as the series goes on, we witness how much comfort the characters have confusing their sense of self and responsibilities. Ah-ee Yoon can’t focus on her home as much, Il Deung-Na does poorly on his exams, and even Eui Lee starts pulling off some shady stunts in the name of protection. Ultimately, the idea behind real magic may be Ah-ee’s ability to live as an adult and as a child, to recover all the splendid youthful days she missed out on because of her family situation. Perhaps, life is the ultimate magic trick, one where we have to live through the realistic lie and deception, knowing it’s simply a contraption for repetition and exhaustion. But at the same time, the concept of magic is a sense of clarity that detaches us from societal expectations, allowing us to find our own spark and path in life. This idea is expressed seamlessly through Il Deung-Na’s realization that he’s on a cold path to nowhere besides where his parents want him to be. The series starts questioning what it truly means to be an adult, and by the end, it’s really about finding a balance between being the child we never got to be yet fulfilling our responsibilities as an adult so that we may present ourselves with the chance to everything else we’ve ever wanted. Life is a compromise, and the magic is everything that’s nice. Slowly, these aspects become the secrets of the silent streets, the quiet of colorful conversation, the relief of raging regrets, and the whispers of words unspoken. The end is left open intentionally so that we can continue how Ah-ee’s story continues, and we relate to her struggles, all the while listening for that opportune moment when we get what we’ve always wanted. Till the very end, we’re left guessing if Eui Lee was ever a real magician, or if he could simply translate the visions in his heads into the eyes of the rest. There’s a magical element to the Annarasumanara, but it has nothing to do with magic — it’s truly about the special people we meet in our lives while understanding that there are things only we care about. Those aspects shine brightest because they speak to us in ways words never can, in ways that we can only feel — that is the sound of magic: an essence that fills our ears with pleasant presence."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Being an adult is not all what its cut out to be. This manwha follows a young woman named Yoon Ah-ee. Her father recently got in debt and now is away from the house, and now she is stuck barely surviving and taking care of her sister. Despite all of this she is very smart just lacks the money and proper parenting. Recently she got a new part time job after getting fired from her old one. She soon gets money but then the precious money that she needed flew away, she desperately follows it and it leads her to this abandoned fair ground. She ... then meets a man who is a magician at the fairground. This is where this story starts. I know alot of you have already seen the synopsis but this will be important later on.. As the story gets developed more we see the theme of 'growing up' and being 'a adult.' With the main character making that statement frequently. But later on in the story she comes to realize that every grown up is still a child on the inside whether they like to show it or not. This is most shown in the magician named 'R' he was sorta like Yoon Ah-ee except he was rich when he was younger. He got good grades and everyone had a great expectations for him. On the inside though 'R' was just blindly following the path that his siblings took without much consideration of what he going to do in the future. This ultimately boiled over into him becoming stressed and dropping out, and following his child like dream to become a magician. 'R' Is a very real representation of how much stress can get put on in younger generations about the future, some can't live up to the expectations and become failures to their parents. The main message that I got from this story is that, you have to worry about your future a little bit, but you don't want to live in the future and not see what is around you in the present because what will you gain from living in the future and not enjoying yourself now. No matter how much money you make or fame you attain it won't matter if you live in the future. Art wise I really liked the art, there are a couple weird images in it, it's almost like the other edited in a picture from google and put in in the manwha. But that's kinda why I liked it. Characters: I couldn't say I got attached to any of the characters but they did seem very real, and dealt with very real concerns that real people deal with everyday. Overall, for such a short manwha it was really enjoyable, and it gives you a valuable lesson about stress, growing up, and being an adult."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Annarasumanara sheds light on topics that will be experienced or have been experienced by everyone. What does it mean to be an adult? How must you live to say you're living well? What about life makes it so stressful and yet so fulfilling? In less than 30 chapters this managed to encapsulate all the feelings I personally have had in the past few months since graduating college. Where do I go from here? Will I fail? Will I succeed? What is my real \"passion\"? Annarasumanara delves into these powerful and difficult topics in an impactful and meaningful manner. It addresses the complexity of being both ... a child and an adult. How to and how not to balance the fear of failure and the complexity of life with the potential of finding real joy and satisfaction. Through the main characters Ah-ee Yoon and Lee Eul, it brings to light that it is okay to be scared or confused, that struggles in life are normal, and that these feelings should be embraced. It gives readers the courage to believe in themselves and to understand that taking risks and trying new things in life is necessary to grow as a person. Annarasumanara offers a bittersweet perspective on growing up, that's both harsh and hopeful. As my first Manwaha, I am both impressed and excited to read more.

Having watched many K-dramas based on mahnwas, I didn't expect Annarasumanara to be any different.

FINAL VERDICT: 7/10 ~Story: 7 + keeps you interested at the most - frequently used plot in manhwa/K-dramas ~Characters: 8 + good development + all characters have some purpose even if it's minor ... - they are cliche at start - main characters have common back stories ~Art: 5 + simple to understand - it's too simple, as if the author didn't want to exert much effort - uses 3D elements which make it pretty weird + but the 2D/3D combination is fascinating at times *The plot is quite similar to Oyasumi Punpun *One of the character's appearance is used as an interpretation of their situation I believe the main idea was that you shouldn't let go of your dreams. It's hard to be an adult in a fixed society where everyone expects you to be something of the norm. It's hard to live in the world of poverty, when people with money can live comfortably. Even so, you can ignore them. Ignore those who tell you to be someone. You can still live and achieve your dreams, even if you're a nobody. Just make sure you get to earn money at the very least lol. RECOMMENDATION RATE: 62% The story is good for people who can't decided whether to work big or start small. It's good to use it as a reference, yes, but I'd advice you to leave it as that.

There is depth to each of the main trio and layers that get peeled off as the story progresses. Lee Eul (the magician) is so mysterious and intriguing. Each of the main three give some kind of insight on how wealth can affect people. The story is quite laid back but is still quite forward moving, enough to make you continue reading at least. The paneling is often outstanding. While it does peak early on, Ha Il Kwon is still so imaginative with the space and magic sections. The message and themes really hit hard. They provide judgement on society's expectations of students ... and the well achieving, as well as the trials and tribulations the poor have to go through to do even basic tasks like buying food. BAD BITS: The art is simple. Characters are simply designed and outfits rarely go beyond a school uniform or suit. The focus is more on the paneling rather than the artwork itself, not that great art isn't present, just that it isn't the focus for most of the story. No spoilers, but the ending is a bit weak, it would've benefited from another chapter or part to explain something: but it doesn't ruin the story or anything bad like that. The theme of poverty takes a bit of a backseat to allow wealth as a whole to drive the story. It's a shame because it's argueably the most interesting and emotional part of the story.

Color is superimposed on certain objects and backgrounds to create a brilliant contrast. It provides a dark and weighty backdrop for the story. The characters themselves feel real.

This is my first review btw, so I'm probably gonna suck but whatever. \"Insert random philosophical quote\" Story: 9/10 The story is simple at the beginning but told in a very effective way. The horror is really well implemented and does not resort to using cheap screamers to create \"fear\". A big portion of the story focuses on the development of the protagonist (Hyun Cha) as he changes his way of being due to the state the world is ... going through. The climax moments are well constructed and the calm sections give moments to think about the situation that the characters are going through and allows to empathize with them in a better way. But it is not perfect since it has its problems, there are a couple of chapters in which nothing that truly mattered for the plot was done and gave me an insufferable boredom to read through, although it did compensate with the suspenseful moments that followed. For me the biggest problem with the the story is at the very end, as it feels quite rushed and some of the things that were hyped up half way through the story ended up being executed way too hastily and without much explanation, although its final moments do fullfil the task of delivering a somewhat satisfying conclusion which caused me to have a mixture of emotions between joy and sadness. Art: 10/10 The art is by far the best aspect of the manwha as almost all suspense scenes are well done thanks in large part to the accompanying art, the settings are simple but done in dark themes that somehow makes them look flashy and creates a good atmosphere for the moment and the characters' reactions to the diverse scenarios that they encounter makes them feel more human but still remaining that fantasy aspect of the manwha, not only that but as well as their designs which are very well done. The artist really achieves the best of his artstyle with this section. Characters: 8/10 The characters are interesting but few are really explored in depth. Hyun Cha is by far the best character of the manwha due to his amazing development which is carried in a very well done pace and manages to empathize with him more and more throughout the progression of the story. Other characters didn't run the same luck as I came to completely hate them due to how they showed the most inhuman and yet realistic side of a character in the worst kind of situations which is a good thing as it represents that not everyone in real life has a sense of heroism or the courage to do selfless acts. Other characters were interesting but weren' explored as much as expected, although they did had their moments that defined them as solid additions to the overall story; while others were very forgetable as they had no interesting aspects or moments whatsoever. As an overall, the main cast was awesome, the supportings were for the most part solid. So I give it an 8 as I would've preferred that the supportings had a much more background as well as development. Enjoyment: 9/10 My enjoyment was present from beggining to end, sure there were some segments in which the characters did nothing and got me bored and decide to stop reading, but for the most part it was great and the suspense accompanied with the amazing artstyle made for an incredible experience I really enjoyed. Overall: 9/10 Overall it's a pretty solid manwha, not as good as Bastard (another manwha created by the same author and artist), but a very solid work that does make it in my approved (and favorites) list and I would definetly recommend it to anyone who wants to read a good horror story along with some great character development."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Sweet Home might seem \"scary\" or \"bloody,\" but Sweet Home is more than a monster webtoon.

So make a fair judgment based on its setting and do not make a comparison of different sorts. When reading a thriller/ horror comic, you must expect: - Lots of overemphasis (reactions, dialogue, atmosphere, etc) - Sides of opposition (Good vs Bad) (Can be sometimes unclear) - Moderate to Heavy focus on character interactions/ development/ backstory - Drama, conflict between characters ... - A fragment of reality (Greed, jealousy, human nature, anxiety, etc) - A profound/ serious story setting and narrating (Little to no comedy) - Modern world building based on Earth (Usually, or completely different) - Negative beginnings (Usually, or different) Getting into the story, the premise is that a teenage boy with an avoidant personality was forced to move into an apartment after being kicked out of his home. Little did he know that his current situation was only the tip of the iceberg after strange monsters started appearing in the world. Now, I won’t say much anymore but know this, it is an apocalyptic series. If you do not like the genre, then you may leave and find another to your liking. But if you’d like to try new things, then do as you please. Below is some explanations why you might not like it, and why might like it. Why You Shouldn’t Read Sweet Home 1. Too serious and edgy to your liking? Repeating it again, Sweet Home is a thriller/ horror series. It is simply being its own genre, nothing more, nothing less. It is not a comedy, a slice of life or anything of relation to genres that are deemed to be less serious. Not only that, the manhwa is set in an apocalyptic world, a world with havoc wreaked upon, so there’s gonna be a lot of seriousness and negativity in the characters and the plot itself. They’re all striving to survive the longest so expect the worst of the worst. But then again, there will be people who will enjoy, there will be those who won’t. That’s that. If you find it too negative or too dark to fit your standards, then simply leave it on the ground and let it be picked up by someone else. 2. Annoying MC? I’ve seen people who complained many times about how much of a big asshole the main character is when they’ve not read beyond 10 chapters. You see, the main character actually thinks, reacts, learns and overcomes. He develops gradually, just as how a human being does and he is influenced by his story and how the characters around him affect him. He’s got a past in which affected his perspective and personality, with difficulties to overcome and learn from. From chapter to chapter, bit by bit you’ll see him walking baby steps in character development, slowly becoming a better person. It takes many chapters till we reach this point so if you’d like an ideal MC starting from the initial chapters to satisfy your entertainment, then leave this series and pick another. 3. You want art like Solo Levelling? Sweet Home has its own certain genre, previously said, but it’s also got its own art style, a way of expressing its atmosphere and characters. It may not be the best but its presentation of its monsters is absolutely disturbing with elaborate details, along with the unsettling background set in behind, enough to fright and capture readers in. In my opinion, I find the art to be suitable for its theme, dark but just the right amount, rough lines but just the right texture, dull but just the right monochromatic colours. However, what we perceive as ‘good’ art is definitely subjective. What I find good might be different to what you consider is good, so if you think the art style of this manhwa is bad, then find another that is to your liking. This series is simply not for you. Moving on to why you might like it. Why You Should Read Sweet Home 1. Three Dimensional Characters, Amazing Development Sweet Home is an apocalyptic series with drama as one of its genres. Now what happens when human-eating monsters start to appear? Havoc wreaks upon the world. Despair, hopelessness, anxiety, greed, jealousy, pity, compassion, all these emotions and feelings start to exhibit from character to character. In the world of Sweet Home, there is no such thing as good or bad in people. Each have their own chosen decisions, afflictions, motivations, thoughts and desires with different pasts which reflect on their perspectives and mindset. As humans, they fight, they kill, they lie, they take and they forgive. There are conflicts and agreements along with the weak and the strong, battling all their efforts to survive. It is simply a display of the current world we live in. Within a world of desolation, you will see a great amount of character development, such as how they adapt, what they change into and why they are what ‘they’ are. Nobody trusts anyone fully and nobody is on one side completely. This means that one can switch sides at any given time and you have to be wary of each characters which adds to the thrill of the manhwa. However, some reactions or expressions might be found as overreacting. But then again, overemphasis is a vital ingredient in thriller in which is what makes it of ‘thriller’ genre. 2. Apocalyptic Story, Interesting Concept Sweet Home is an apocalyptic story with an interesting concept, if not almost original, which is why it is quite different from other series of the same theme and genre. It’s not one of those movies where crazy ass people cruise in their vehicle, shooting at monsters while doing a war cry. The story presents well of how strong monsters are compared to humans, and humans have measly power compared to them, bringing anticipation onto the table for you. People instead form alliances and work together in order to survive and fight back. But you will never know when one retaliates. It may start out small, but it gets bigger. Some say reading this was a thrilling ride, with heart-dropping moments. Some found it to be a manhwa full of anticipation and suspense. It’s all about what you prefer. You either like it or dislike it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "____*Spoiler Free*____ Sweet Home, The manhwa that a lot of people know because of Bastard. I thought, Bastard was a masterpiece. But now after reading Sweet Home, Sweet Home came to my first place VERY fast. The story is definitely a thriller, my anxiety was almost continuously high. I've read it and not once I thought low of it, this story is so well done, it's deep and the art is also beautiful. I can't really explain it itself, you should (if you haven't) just go and read it and have this experience for yourself. I really hope you'll enjoy this manhwa just as much as I ... did!"}, {"score": "10", "content": "Note: My reviews are like a note for my future self. I try to not spoil anything in it, because in the case I want to reread the books, I don't want to know too much about it other than what I think I will remember or surface level details that don't really matter much. I just want to make sure my future self understands a bit of how I felt about it and why I gave this mark. Wow, now this is what I love. Being taken by surprise. Started reading this on a whim, and after a few chapters, some parts of the story ... started to feel similar to something I knew already... and then a comment said that it has a Netflix show by the same name and everything clicked. I remembered watching the adaptation when it came out, in like 2020, because I remember hearing it was a good adaptation... but imo, it didn't really make much of an impact on me, I completely forgot about it and whatever its story was, I just remembered some scenes from the beginning of the show. But once I kept reading... I just couldn't let it go... read 122 chapters in one go, could have finished it same day if I didn't have work the next day and had to sleep... But man, this was a really good read, loved it trough and trough, from start to finish, almost everything about it... Story: 9/10 The story is interesting, it has a good premise and works on it really well. Everything feels... natural... even the conversations between characters... they all fit together. It gives you a really good sense of immersion... too bad I personally cannot really get as much into a manhwa as into an anime for example when it comes to emotions, but it still made me feel things like shock, sadness, almost even a tear came out, curiosity coupled with adrenaline of what is going to happen... and because of that, I just loved it. Top notch storytelling! Art: 9/10 The art isn't very complex, BUT, it fit perfectly with the story. The characters always had really well drawn expressions and you could feel what they were feeling, and the monsters... man.... so many unique designs that were really good. As I said, it coupled really well with the story. Characters: 9/10 Characters interactions felt natural to me, which makes a big impact Well, not 100% of the time it was like that, of course, but it was enough times to make me get used to the characters and get closer to them and actually believe in them and wish for their success. There are quite a few really well put characters that you will like for sure, each having their own pretty interesting qualities and characteristics, that don't end up being in an archetype that you can instantly guess everything about them. This also gives this story a big bonus in my eyes, because it became way harder to read what it's going to happen next. And that uneasiness coupled with everything came perfectly together. Enjoyment: 10/10 As you might have guessed it already, I loved this story, instantly hooked to it and just kept going, always wanting to know what happens next. Overall: 10/10 Wait... it doesn't add up to a 10? I bet that's what you're thinking... well, good thing you're still good at math. While it doesn't add up to 10, for me it felt like a 10 overall, even tho if you take each part out, you cannot really say that part is a 10, but coupled together between them, and with the storytelling it has, bam, recipe for a 10! Maybe I am also a bit harsh on the marks, but hey, once you've seen a few masterpieces in certain categories, hardly anything can reach those, y'know? This manhwa has right now 8.26 from 38.764 votes Ranked #351 Popularity #197 Members 75,688 as of 27/02/2024. Good mark. Highly recommend it to people that want to see a good story with good characters and storytelling, that is mostly a seinen story with a bit of horror, and where it's just... enjoyable and great. Now onto Shotgun Boy..."}, {"score": "8", "content": "*The story is not yet finished, so this only reflects the early chapters* This Manwa is the type of post-apocalyptic story that one could enjoy. I enjoy an excellent monster-related tale, and this is right down my ally. The psychological theme behind the monsters is genuinely magnificent. *Minor spoilers territory.* Stroy 8/10 The setting of the story is delightful, to begin with. The whole story so far was centered around one single building, very similar to the movie and novel mist. This one singular building reflects the devastation humanity is facing during this apocalypse. During this extreme period, we could see the struggle that people face, ... such as sacrifices and pain. It enhanced people as they are; the violent people grew more violent; the kind people became more compassionate; the selfish people became more selfish. It is fascinating to see people turning against each other and clashes. Another exciting gimmick is that the monsters that are destroying their ordinary life have initially been humans. Meaning, anyone could turn at any point, which further turned the survivors against themselves. Not only that, but the trigger that turns humans into monsters was also their desire; the stronger the desire, the faster they will convert. The monster will reflect their desire and be an extremely enhanced version of that desire. For example, a former bodybuilder had a dream to be extremely fit, so he turned into a hulk-like muscle backed being. This allowed the author to explore the depth of the human mind further. However, I couldn't give it a full score because there are a few places where it doesn't make sense. Some character's motives were not entirely justified and do things just because they are bad people, which is not how real humans act. This could just be the fact that there are way too many characters, and it is hard to manage all of them, which is entirely understandable. Art 9/10 The art is elementary and easy to understand, but the monster is still really manacing. The pacing and mood control with the panel is merely incredible. The cliff hanger at the end of every chapter is enough to push anyone to the next. Because this is a Korean Manwa, it does not reply on page turn; Instead, it uses scrolling, which is a whole new experience. Character 9/10 I feel like this is the best part of the story. Even though there are a few that didn't make sense, as I said earlier, but the main character and most others do feel like real humans. I could see people making the decisions that they made during the run-up of the story. They do have exaggerated features, as all fiction character does, but other than that they are pretty realistic. The mother who lost her kid wanted to protect others. The former police who sees himself as justice. The gamer who is helping others because he wanted to feel in charge. All of them are excellent and real characters that I can get behind. In this situation, there are no villains; everyone does something to gain something. Which also fed the theme.

It's been a while since I've read a story about zombies (I'm referring to highschool of the dead or the manhua Moshi fanren ) ... but this manhwa is just a completely new and original way of a zombie apocalypse. It's not the overused principle of an unknown entity from space or a mutated super virus. It's astonishing how the manhwa's art style is so perfect for this manga that every time the protagonist or every other character is in a moment of despair or immeasurable fear the reader can relate and even feel the fear alongside every character (a least for me for example when Hyun was hiding in the bathroom of his room and fell asleep while peeing and suddenly the faceless monster said: THERE YOU ARE!)

I think the biggest positive of this series is the intrigue brought on by wondering just how many types of monsters were out there roaming around and how they worked. The actual best part of this series is the mystery and not the horror or even ... the story. Where ever the story laks is made up by the awesome environments drawn on the pages.

I have no praises nor qualms against kdrama, but when I'd seen that the kdrama was based off of a manhwa, I had to read it. The manhwa was really good. It got me on the edge of my seats as I was scrolling through the pages. As a thriller, it truly lives up to its name. As a manhwa, I can say that it's strongest aspects were the story and the characters. It gave me Parasyte/Jagaaaaaan/Prototype vibes when I was reading it. Story 8/10 The ... story doesn't get even near to some top tier manga, but as a manhwa, it's far superior than it's peers. Don't get me wrong, the story is really good. I wouldn't do anything to the story if I was given the chance to change it. Art 6/10 Now, I have mixed feelings about the art. Unlike the typical webtoon standard that involves a white background for non illustrations, they basically put a dark one and I think that's a smart move. It really gives off that uneasy vibe. As for the jumpscares, the way they presented it to the readers is simply amazing. The horror aspect of this manhwa really delivers well to me. But I find the action scenes disappointingly lackluster, particularly Hyun's action sequences. That probably turned me off more than all the redeeming qualities combined. I would rate it a 4 or 5 if it weren't for the fact that Hyun literally transformed into an OP version of Alex Mercer's Armored Form. Characters 8/10 I've always thought Hyun is an asshole at the beginning. But upon witnessing his backstory, I couldn't help but sympathize with him. The guy's been through lot because of his life got flipped out by some entitled piece of shit bully(I really hope he dies a slow and painful death) Then Jisu. I like how she values life more than anyone in the series because of her past. It would make sense that she would also fill the role of preventing Hyun killing himself. Enjoyment 9/10 I enjoyed it. A LOT. Probably more than most of the manhwa I've read. It's on par of my enjoyment with tower of god. Not a lot of manhwa gets me hyped for every chapter to see what happens next. Overall 9/10 With all things considered, this manhwa is a one in a million. The manhwa world is saturated with stories that just SUCK with the art as the only compensation for that. I have no obvious complaints for that. I'd like my monkey brain to take over sometimes and not stress over some complicated story.

I found it randomly on webtoon a month before it became a daily pass, and I'm glad I got to read it without cliffhangers. The action has so much tension, it just keeps you reading for hours with that `just one more chapter` thought and that's how I spent my nights for the past few weeks. Story: 10/10 The story is not one of those endless things that make ... you even forget where it all started. It's short and to the point. Almost everything happens in a single building, in a rather short time. The plot is really interesting and also intriguing. It's based on everyone's inner desire and makes you question yourself `what if I was in there?` or `what would I do in such a situation?` Art: 10/10 The art is just perfect according to the genre imo. What more could someone ask for a thriller? The dark shades and the lack of bright colors get it even more onto the point. You can only see bright backgrounds when someone's smiling to show the readers that `even the blackest darkness disappears in the faintest light`. Characters: I'd give it an 11/10 if I could This is the best part of this manhwa. Almost every character has a backstory portrayed at some point, showing us that there's a reason why they became like that. Every character had their moment and everyone got to show what they're made of. The mc displays one of the most complex character development. Unfortunately, not all of the heroes of the story make it out alive, but we get to learn a lesson about the importance of our lives from every death. Enjoyment: 10/10 I was literally living through this manhwa while reading. I'm gonna miss the emotions a had every night reading it. I WANT TO READ IT ALL OVER AGAIN FOR THE FIRTS TIME. I re-read the final chapter sometimes and I still get tears in my eyes. Some of them from sadness, and some of them from happyness.

At its best, Sweet Home takes the classic building under siege format popularized by zombie stories and spins it into a bizarro man vs monster battle series that does just enough interesting and weird things to make most battles feel harrowing and victories well earned. When the story focuses on the characters however, as it does much in the second half, the experience falls into the same worst tropes of the genre and becomes lost in ... it's own navel as it flounders to the finish line. The fact that Sweet Home's environmental and combat visual storytelling lift it well beyond the mediocrity of the actual narrative is a feat worth celebrating, but the really impressive element that I found myself greatly appreciating all the way to the end was the care and attention put into continuity and resolving the various set-ups way later on. The story is at its best in these moments, when a brief innocuous scene or unexplained encounter from dozens on chapters ago come rushing back into relevancy to alter the story in fun and surprising ways. So great is quality of these often small but poignant moments that often circle around the various humans-turned-monsters that I found myself far more attached to the broken terrors hunting the real humans than the humans themselves. The fantastic subtext and implications of various scenes did so much more to elevate the experience, where the near constant edgelord exchanges with the main protagonist and his inner monster-self (or really any of the dialogue for that matter) often undercut moments and prevented the story from ever reaching the peak of it's potential. While I will soon go on a self-indulgent tangent about the frustrations I have with the wider story, plenty of praise needs to be healed on the incredible panel work and use of the modern manhwa format as a tension building device. The general character art is surprisingly weak and lulls the reader in a false sense of security with generally forgettable designs before slamming it's mutated fist into your temple with incredibly detailed walking abominations that constantly defy logic in increasingly grotesque ways. Even when the narrative itself is at its worse the panel work never fails to make the most of each scene, with environment art often so rich that you can practically smell the asbestos. Reading this series on my phone was utterly sublime, as with each flick of my thumb tension would build. Scenes are broken up just right to leave the reader holding their breath as the climax of an encounter is reached, with no drawing wasted in painting the kinetic energies practically vibrating off the page. No other encounter best encapsulates the incredible experiences of Sweet Home for me than \"The Runner,\" which if you know, you know. In spite of this personal peak Sweet Home ups continues to experiment with encounters that keeps each new creature introduced a mystery into itself, and once they find their way onscreen you won't be able to take your eyes off them. So effective is the art and panel direction that it took me getting to around a third of the way through for me to realize there is next to no gore in the entire series. The visceral impacts and horrible vectors of violence monsters use belie a surprisingly tame result that I barely noticed, so captivating is the tension of Sweet Home's best encounters. If this same story was told without any of the flare or experimentation that Sweet Home constantly explores (i.e.; the awful Netflix adaptation), this wouldn't have been the blowout success it's become. Full stop. It's entirely deserving of it's success and shouldn't be missed. Now that I've rid myself of all that pesky positivity, before you dive into my spoiler-ish rant please consider going in blind. It's best read without any expectations; just know that the ending doesn't really live up to the beginning but that it's worth reading anyway. General spoilers to follow: While I personally found the inter-personal drama often frustratingly weak and handled with all the subtly grace of a semi-truck barrelling into a busy intersection, this cannot be said for when established characters fully transform into monsters; effectively, when the characters shut up and become whatever wildly creative nightmare, it is always a pleasure. It is worth getting invested enough with the characters despite how utterly insufferable many of them are just to see these blow-out moments that are often as funny as they are unsettling–and in turn often redeeming the more absurdly one-dimensional characters in the process. Sweet home is at its best when it lets a scene breathe–a basic sense that feels like it becomes lost in the desperate sprint to the end. Much of the narrative is told in a series of flashbacks, and these are often a mixed bag. Universally, the less dialogue there is in Sweet Home, the more effective the experience. On the topic of the main character Hyun, this is especially true. Hyun was scientifically created in a lab to be the most absurdly tragic teenage protagonist known to man, and this comes through most potently through his flashbacks. It's the kind of hyperreal nihilism of the extreme cruelty that man does to man that is as believable as it is farcical–and no where else is this at its worst than the first few chapters. To Hyun and the authors credit, the narrative does explore poignant modern themes of social isolation and abandonment. The extremes the narrative goes to justify Hyun's situation ultimately hurts the message it's trying to send, as when you learn his full backstory it comes off as less believable than the entire world turning into monsters. Once his backstory resolves about midway through the series, following Hyun so closely becomes incredibly stale, as he attains no new abilities or skillets and falls into a role of poke-and-shock that resolves most conflicts along the way. It's at this point the narrative wisely shifts to focusing on the wider cast and crew, but in a frustrating turn Sweet Home sidelines most of the characters built up through the first half to focus on the other survivors and later a group of escaped convicts that disrupt the narrative progress indefinitely. I will try to not lose myself in the all-consuming hatred I feel towards the final few arcs, but suffice to say the worst elements of Sweet Home take center stage and puts it's absolute worst characters in positions of importance that defy logic, and turns the knob of unlikability on some of them to 11. There is one particular character that gets an absurd amount of screen time who is nothing but an endless streak of cruelty and cowardice that puts everyone in danger for no reason, who's very existence makes the previous worst member of the cast seem like gold in comparison, and yet the story actually expects me to care about their plight. While they outlive a good number of far more interesting characters, their death is so cathartically pathetic that I actually pumped my fist in the air. It is a damn shame how little time is spent with the wide cast of generally interesting characters by the end. Much of this time is wasted on the previously mentioned human garbage, but mostly on the late introduced gang of prisoners who feel pulled out of a generic mafia manga from 1984. You have the Negan-esque leader, the manipulative conman, the one with the gun, the molesty one, and the unassuming CRAZY one. Whatever you picture in your head, you aren't far off. It doesn't help that their designs are utterly amateurish and incredibly un-intimidating, but it's at this point that the whole hook to the series–monsters–is reduced to a background element of tension rather than being the consistently exciting threat they had been up to this point. This final arc takes up the biggest chunk of the story and is the absolute worst by a country mile, before wrapping Sweet Home up in a rather cumbersome ending. It all goes about how you'd expect, with predictable twists and and \"revelations\" to the criminals lies and plans that I found myself saddened that these late inclusions were what we were closing out an otherwise compelling series on. It's in this final circuit that the story truly stagnates, with the creatures bat their most uninspired (with one handsome exception) and the big mystery that kicks off the final monster raid leading to a frustrating exposition dump that explains everything, thus removing the final layer of excitement I had held up to this point. The final clash is made enjoyable for an overt Berserk reference, but otherwise falls into the same traps of tell don't show that the final half is plagued with. It is still a high point compared to the chapters preceding it, but there is a rushed quality to it that further undercuts the ending's potential in what feels like a narrative crisis the author was doing their best to make the best of. Despite all this, Sweet Home should not be missed for anyone craving a fresh take on the action-horror genre. Even in its worst moments it still kept me turning the page, and at its best it can screw with your emotions and elicit equal amounts of fear and excitement like the best of them. It's a shame about the ending, but despite my frustrations it leaves no plot thread unresolved and delivers an overall satisfying conclusion and (blessedly) dialogue-less epilogue that feels earned. With it's sequel \"Shotgun-boy\" now in syndication, I'm curious to see if it's able to differentiate itself enough and grow past Sweet Home, or if it will fall into the same narrative shortcomings of it's predecessor. I will never forget the happy surprise I felt when I finally gave this series a chance back when webtoons first caught on, and Sweet Home will always be my starter recommendation to anyone looking outside traditional mediums. While I feel it ultimately didn't live up to its potential, I am thrilled to see the author hasn't rested on their laurels. Where ever this monsterized universe goes, I plan to follow."}, {"score": "7", "content": "I went into this completely blind and when the monsters showed up, I was completely surprised. I liked the feeling of being trapped inside an apartment building surviving. I also liked Hyun scrolling through the internet and texting Hyuk. There were so many good characters and death scenes but my biggest complaint is Hyun being badass and going into every fight. I like how he got his head smashed in but since he was infected he survived but after that it all felt meh whenever Hyun was fighting. Unless someone else's life is involved, but Jisu I hate her. Shes cool but Hyun just keeps ... saving her life when she suicidal. Hyun would've lived longer if he didn't save her in the end. Jisu outlived her usefulness, but she tried to save the group at the end which got Hyun killed. I hate how Hyun tries saving everyone, but I also like it when he fails. Not completely though because there are great characters that die and its depressing (I'm glad Hyun doesn't win all the time, but regarding Jisu he does. which I hate) I like how Hyun was trapped in his room and him meeting Dusik and the horror element. I also loved Jayhun who had a katana and believed in god. He was awesome and I cant believe he died. Its depressing. We saw a bit of him before the apocalypse which was awesome. Speaking of, Hyuns backstory is great. It totally fits who he is and I like how by the end we see more of the Disease inside Hyun promising him a better life whenever Hes a monster. To be fair I think Hyun is too aggressive for someone who's on the internet a lot. True living and saving people in this world takes courage but damnn Hyun adjusted quick (to be fair he was stuck in his room a lot and was infected) I like Hyuk even if he was a dick sometimes, but hes smart and likes anime too. Him and Hyun were awesome too see, whenever he wasnt using Hyun. I wish Hyuk used more of the other monsters or at least tried to spot them out. (just a wish it def dosent need to happen) I liked the survival aspect and clearing floors with monsters. Than whenever the prison bus arrives everything gets awesome. New characters, new mysteries, and new conflict. I like how everything felt tense whenever the prisoners came along. I also like how they had good lore behind them and they connected to Wook. I didnt like how one of the prisoners tried to kill Dusik. Apart form that they all were cool, they died quickly though but some of them were a good part of the cast. the guy that was half monster and half human was really cool and adds stuff to the lore. I like his multiple personalities but he left Hyun to save Jisu top chase after a monster which was very questionable but apart from that he was really cool and awesome and powerful. Now talking the ending its pretty good especially Hyuk and Hyuns part in it. Hyun had to become a monster to take out the prisoners leader and he turned into his favorite series sheild hero and took it out easily but Hyun was a monster now and he had to be stopped thankfully Hyuk who was also infected took a huge blow by Hyun and held him trying to stop Hyun from killing the others. Sadly Hyuk and Hyun die and they both turn into eggs like the one lady who lost her baby. everyone left alive escape to the military. I really liked Hyuks backstory and his sister. They were awesome characters and Hyuk had to leave his sister just like his father did to him which was depressing. Whenever the virus confronted him about it he said he didnt have a choice which the virus replied neither did his dad. Thats super sad. I like how they died together though. I wish they didnt have to die. Honestly i wish Jisu died instead of them. They both were great characters and reflected well off of each other whenever they werent being serious. Its depressing. I still like the ending though (apart form the last panel which ruins Hyun turning into a egg) Hyuk becoming infected was sad especially when Wook had to help him get out of the locked apartment whenever the prisoners held them hostage. Husiks death was depressing too. The way it affected Hyun was sad. Because Husik was the first person Hyuk really saw after the apocalypse."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I am on the verge of crying 😭 This was a great read 👏 It is very unpredictable with the death of characters and be ready to see the characters you like die but that improves the quality of the story tenfold And makes the stakes even higher last chapter left me all salty but to see hyun intact with his emotions even after his reincarnation and went to his new home ..... his sweet home yes we didn't get to know what happened to the world did the world recover from this apocalypse but that doesn't matter because this was the story of the boy who lost ... his kind self and his sweet home this story was his journey of Hyun being his former self with a new sweet home"}, {"score": "9", "content": "*Spoiler free* Whew. I really want this to become an anime. There’s a live action on Netflix but it doesn’t do it justice in my opinion. On to the review! Story: The story is pretty solid. It doesn’t require much thinking. It’s pretty cut and dry. I kind of wish there was more of an in-depth explanation for why the thing was happening but I guess that’s what the prequel is for (Shotgun Boy). I think the author did a great job conveying the fear that was instilled in the characters. I truly felt a lot of their pain and regrets. The gore was really good ... and the psychological/horror aspect was on point. It’s hard to find a solid horror comic (for me) but this one will satisfy apocalyptic and horror fans. 9/10 Characters: Your average characters. It’s an apocalyptic world you could say, so the author did a good job displaying that power struggle and the hunger to be in charge. In the real world, everyone has their own ideas of how things should be ran and not everyone will get along. It’s shown in movies like The Purge, The Platform, Cube, and many other horror films. I really enjoyed this aspect of the story. The main character isn't anything special. Your typical main character. Wants to do the right thing, doubts their capabilities, etc. There are unlikeable characters but they are meant to unliked. You’ll know what I mean if you read it. There are also really likeable characters who are very smart, cunning, witty, and bad ass. 8/10 Art: I was iffy on the art. I hated it in the beginning but the story was so good that I overlooked it. However, I’ve reread this story a couple of times and it has grown on me. Definitely not my favorite art style but it’s not the worst. I love the way the author drew the antagonists (don’t want to say what the antagonists are). Very creepy and creative. I actually got chills with some of the designs. 7/10 Enjoyment/Overall: A very good horror comic compared to a lot of other ones out there. The author did a great job on the story and art. If you’re wanting something creepy, I’d suggest it. I highly enjoyed it. It’s something that you could stay up till 1 o’clock in the morning reading. 9/10"}, {"score": "8", "content": "This the second manhwa that i have read , and it was amazing from start to finish and i want to breakdown everything rn Story : Hyun is a reclusive high school student who spends his days holed up in his room playing video games.

Faltou mostrar a de alguns eu diria, mas a dos que tem são BEM legais. E não sei se isso foi só pra mim, porém, faltou um pouco de terror e teve BEM mais ação do q eu pensei q teria na obra.

He isn't quite a hero which I like since he is kinda just like a normal dude but with a tragic story. I also like how he isn't really overpowered and how realistic some of the situations are if the Sweet Home circumstance happened IRL. I also like how the story still makes Hyun's depression and self harm a large part of the story without it being too dark and emo.

{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/174045/I_Love_Amy", "reviews": [{"score": "10", "content": "If you only glance at I Love Amy, you might think it’s just a quirky high school rom-com drawn in a cutesy cartoon style — the kind of story that plays it safe with pastel-colored feelings and harmless crushes. But chapter by chapter, this manhwa slowly dismantles that impression and replaces it with something much more raw, tender, and unsettling. At its core, it’s the story of two broken girls: Bibi, a borderline psychotic rich kid with a deeply fractured psyche and a freezer full of taxidermied pets, and Amy, a quiet Korean immigrant living in the U.S., still haunted by the childhood trauma of ... a mother who once tried to kill her. Their meeting is accidental, manipulative, even absurd — Bibi pulls Amy into a ridiculous scheme to win over the school’s golden boy — but what follows is a strangely beautiful, emotionally intimate, and sometimes deeply uncomfortable bond between two people learning how to give and receive love for the first time. Through the simplest moments — cooking together, watching TV, falling asleep in the same bed — Amy becomes a source of healing for Bibi, and Bibi, chaotic and obsessive as she is, helps Amy find a sense of agency and visibility. The manhwa’s recurring metaphor of a cookie jar — empty at the start, slowly filled one “biscuit” at a time with Amy’s kindness — perfectly captures the emotional growth at the story’s center. And yet, despite its darkness (gun-waving declarations of love, jealousy, abandonment, trauma therapy, and even alien abductions), what truly defines I Love Amy is an unexpected softness. The art, which draws more from Western indie comics than traditional manga, adds to this with its round eyes, flat colors, and expressive faces. There's even a subtle love triangle, with Camilla — Amy’s loyal childhood friend — quietly carrying unspoken feelings that add further depth to the story’s emotional tension. In the final arc, even the quirky side characters like cynical Linda and extraterrestrially-traumatized Katelyn get their own romantic closure, as if the manhwa is whispering: no one is too strange, too broken, or too lost to find love. I Love Amy is not perfect, and it never tries to be — but it’s one of those rare stories that manages to be funny, disturbing, and profoundly sweet all at once. It doesn't romanticize trauma, but it dares to show how love — awkward, chaotic, healing love — can exist even in the darkest places. And that might be the most comforting message of all."}, {"score": "8", "content": "🎶🎶 Oh, she's sweet but a psycho A little bit psycho At night, she's screamin' \"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind\" Oh, she's hot but a psycho So left but she's right, though At night, she's screamin' \"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind\"🎶 Well I certainly didn’t expect a cutesy looking manhwa would be pretty tense, dark and interesting. We see crazy Yandere-like gal Bibi who is obsessed with Peter, the most popular boy in the school and wants him badly to be his girl. She drags poor shy gal herself, Amy to help her out in leading Peter to her demise. I liked how the author also deep dived into both girls backgrounds on why they ... act the way the act. It was heartbreaking to witness Amy’s mother leaving her in a hot car as a child and it almost killed her. Of course she is arrested and Amy lives with her loving aunt. We also see Bibis parents were killed in a plane crash and her oddball uncle is her guardian.

I recommend this series for everyone who loves GL and wants an interesting and fun read, with some heartfelt moments and a heartwarming message (love heals 🩷). Amy is a shy girl with complex trauma that has low-self-esteem and believes that she should never fall in love with anyone. ... Bibi is a yandere rich girl that behaves in psychopathic ways and is obsessed with living the perfect love story with a popular boy. The two of them end up hanging out together and developing a strong connection in the mean time. What makes this story unique is how well their actions and trauma is addressed and handled.

In my opinion, the events that happen in the present are also very well presented, which makes up for an entertaining and compelling story."}, {"score": "9", "content": "At first glance, I had fairly low expectations. This was my first dive into anything labeled manhwa, and the art style wasn't 100% up my alley... but then I started reading. Damn this was such an excellent read! The characters are what they seem and more, and I love that the story isn't shy to show that. BiBi is the crazy yandere girl that everyone avoids, and that is not hyperbolic. She has some actual issues and shows psychopathic tendencies. While she is terribly flawed, she is very intelligent and fun to watch as she learns more about herself and those around her.. people she never ... even acknowledged before meeting Amy. Amy seems like a simple character at first: shy, quiet, and easy to manipulate. It's as you learn about her character and her past that she really begins to shine. Confusion becomes conclusions in the sense of, \"Of course she would respond that way.\" While each other side character is interesting, I really feel like mentioning Camilla as well. She is so complex, as she fits the popular cheerleader trope while being so much more. It's hard to figure out exactly what she feels about Amy, but learning about her and her past with Amy makes things more clear. The events in this story are really silly, interesting, and shocking. Learning about Snowball is a great example of \"of course,\" \"what the fuck,\" and \"how are you okay with this?!\" that will be experienced over and over again. BiBi makes the story hard to predict at times and overly predictable other times. The events are so intriguing, as watching how a psychopath learns and grows during her chase is never quite easy to follow. The side stories and background characters are as interesting as the main story, and the various circumstances kept me reading well after I should have. 9/10 I HIGHLY recommend reading this story!

The artistry is exceptional, the strokes sublime, leaving one ... speechless; the characters are stunningly portrayed. If you didn't like Izek, here's a message for you: Patience is key with this man.

Keep in mind, I've only read what is translated of the manhwa so far, and it's based on a novel that is still being translated as well, I enjoyed this story enough I would read the novel - and honestly would probably enjoy it more. I do agree that the story is pretty mid at face value, though I loved all the repressed anger from the FL. Seeing her hold everything in and struggle to keep from boiling over at points kept me reading! Obviously, this is an ... isekai romance, so it has your pretty typical isekai characteristics; doesn't pay much attention to settings, world building, side plots etc. It focuses pretty heavily on the main characters. This may be different in the novel - as this manhwa has stock backgrounds and whatnot. The characters are fairly decent. You are meant to dislike the male lead initially due to his very cold-duke-of-the-north type persona, but give him time. FL is pretty average, though she has some inner demons that I have yet to come across in similar stories. I really liked her backstory and felt for her a lot, I found myself cheering her on whenever she broke her innocent girl façade. As far as the other characters, I think the male lead's sister is pretty well done and interesting, as well as the antagonist (though you don't know too much about them yet in the manhwa) The one thing I will say about the FL is she is always getting into trouble/hurt/needing rescuing, which is something I've grown particularly tired of, but it's sort of to be expected with these stories. If that's something that really bothers you, you may not like this one. The art is very nice! It's pretty typical of the genre, and the backgrounds don't get too much love, but I found the main characters to be pleasing to look at. I can't say much else until it finishes, but I'd say it does stand out above some others in the genre - but not quite super unique thus the 7 \"good\" rating from me. Overall I would recommend to those that love the genre!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "I have read a lot of historical Isekai manhwa and this started off the same as your average Isekai/villainess combo. What's different about this one is probably how the characters where written. I know there are some people who despised the FL for being \"weak\" but I would like to debunk this. Ruby has been through a lot. Imagine getting abused by her family both in her real world and the novel that she's in right now, do you think it's easy for her to feel fine after that? I think the way she reacts to things is how a human who has been through a ... lot of trauma would react. It's not weakness, she's just human. Idk this isn't really a review but just me defending Ruby from those comments. I was really forcing myself not to cry while reading the panels on how she was abused and how she was slowly starting to open herself up thanks to her heaven sent husband who was kinda a jerk at first but totally redeemed himself at the latest chapters. Honestly instead of directing such comments to Ruby just curse the hell out of that fricking Caesar. Might've spelt his name wrong, but do I look like I care? Anywayssss, I thought no one could surpass my hatred with Trashta but then here come that abuser taking her throne. I think the author is trying to tell us that \"Don't let looks deceive you\" because that guy is an ABSOLUTE HORRENDOUS MONSTER THAT NEEDS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS WORLD. Okay that's it, in summary... Artstyle is a 10. Characters is a 10. Plot is good. I recommend it.

(Contains spoilers) I saw another reader point this out in the comment section of this manhwa, where they said that she continuously goes through the same things, etc. and is saved by the male lead, Iske, in the end. This is true, but it has made the characters in the manhwa realise many things, as as include opportunities for a romantic moment and a dilemma. Secondly, she trips way too often. I know it's normal to stumble or be clumsy now and then, but the author uses ... this way too often. There are multiple illustrations of her tripping often, which would probably be over ten times (no exaggeration at all). I feel like the writer could've used something else to build a closer bond between the FL and the ML, but I can tell that these moments were only meant to slightly contribute to their relationship and intend for them to build their way up. Our antagonist, Freya, is quite interesting. She is an antagonist who will hide herself from others. Usually, in romance manhwas, the antagonist will reveal herself quite early into the plot. However, this one was different. I'm pretty pleased with how the author created Freya as well as her personality, it's different from other manhwas that I've read. Adding on to the dark side of the story, the author does not forget to include the De Borgia family. We see a chapter now and then including Cesare, Rudbeckia's elder brother. This reminds us of a number of events that will happen in the later chapters that will involve him, just like a warning. I would say the author's writing techniques are quite average, but this gives a nice addition to the story. I would recommend this manhwa to anyone who enjoys a romantic plot! It includes a historical setting and sweet romantic moments, with a sprinkle of magic. A bit of everything for the readers! TL;DR - The plot is quite repetitive at times, but slowly gets better.

They're all addressed respectfully and as bad as they are!) And I think what makes the story even more heartbreaking is that some of the main characters are based on real people! The Borgia family existed, and the worst of all, Cesare too. The mere thought of that makes my stomach ... hurt. I can only hope there was someone like Izek too... Really, just go read it.

What starts as a survival story set in a cold, calculated world slowly transforms into a powerful tale of healing, resilience, and love that’s earned, not given freely. The story follows Ruby de Borgia, a young woman who’s faced more cruelty than most people could bear. Branded by her past and married off to Izek, a powerful knight of the Holy Empire, her journey begins not with love, but with fear and the desire to simply survive. Watching Ruby navigate a new life where she’s seen as an ... outsider, enduring emotional isolation and misunderstanding, is heart wrenching. And yet, her strength shines in the quiet moments, the times when she continues to try, despite everything. What really makes this story special is the slow and deeply satisfying evolution of her relationship with Izek. He’s cold at first, distant, and emotionally unavailable, but never truly cruel. As the story progresses, you get to see how Ruby’s sincerity, courage, and vulnerability begin to chip away at his walls. Watching him soften, protect her, and slowly fall in love without even realizing it is such a rewarding experience. It’s not rushed, it takes time, and that’s what makes it feel real. The writing is thoughtful, and the emotional pacing is masterful. There’s political intrigue, palace dynamics, and external threats, but the core of the story is always Ruby’s emotional growth and the way she reclaims her self worth. The artwork is stunning, rich, elegant, and expressive, especially in moments of emotional tension or quiet affection. Every panel feels like it was crafted with care. If you love stories where love grows from broken beginnings, where characters actually develop, and where romance feels earned through trust and time, How to Win My Husband Over is an unforgettable read. It’s a story of survival, yes, but more than that, it’s a story of hope."}, {"score": "4", "content": "Read one chapter. Saw the name \"Borgia\" and references to the Pope. Flashbacks to theology class. I begin sobbing and reciting the Pater Noster. I will never escape the Catholic Church. Help me. The art is pretty good. The plot and characters and blatantly stolen from 15th century European politics. Which is fine. Retellings are fine. Maybe what the Papal States really needed was one isekaied mc to romance away generations of political strife. Maybe an Italo-Spanish noblewoman (daughter of the pope????) can marry an English knight and it helps ease tensions between noble families. Fine. Sure. But I can't enjoy it because I love European ... history and every page there's some reference that breaks me and suddenly I'm reading a book on Pope Alexander VI and slavery. I'm 35 chapters in now and it's really average. Good art, mid plot, it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything new with the historical isekai romance genre. The tropes feel kinda tired. The only exciting thing is the rage it inspires within me when I see the Pope commit nepotism. All the characters are heretics and sinners which is fine I just am weird about this. I would recommend this if you're into the history of the Southern European Renaissance. Otherwise, yeah you can read it but it's the same as any other comics like it. Doesn't stick with you. I could not pick the characters out of a lineup of other characters. Generic. Maybe read as a time filler if you're bored, but no special enjoyment was gained from me."}]}

That's exactly how my experience reading this particular manhwa was. The feelings of isolation from all the restrictions, always surrounded by very high expectations, always needing to give it your all even though it's not particularly rewarding, and most importantly, constantly feeling lonely in a hard, unwanted journey. Such were the things that I have felt as I began following Shuli's, the main character of this story, journey. Shuli led a tiring life. Being married off to a Marquis at a young age by her very own family for financial advantages, her once commoner life turned ... into a noble one wherein she finds herself taking on the responsibility of becoming the head of a noble family while being a mother, a stepmother to kids that were very close to her age. The burden became heavier when the Marquis she married to died from a disease, making her shoulder the responsibility the Marquis had. As I already mentioned, her life is a very restricted one. She did not have the freedom to do what she wants and instead, live a life that someone else decided for her. It was very suffocating to see how much she struggled in order to bear the responsibility that she vowed to carry. Reading this manhwa was like managing an endless maze, it's dark, uncertain, and scary. But perhaps that's the reason why it always felt so fulfilling and warm whenever she accomplished her goals, big or small. Being acknowledged not just by the nobles that expect much from her, but by her own (step) children that she felt had once shunned her (from her previous life), are the greatest and happiest feelings I felt reading this manga. Seeing Shuli get rewarded for her efforts was the sole reason why I was able to keep reading this manhwa. Despite the seemingly endless suffocation I had to feel, every happy moment she was able to gain due to her persistence was enough to make me continue to follow her hard, yet incredibly fulfilling and warm journey. The Fantasie of a Stepmother, or A Stepmother's Märchen as it is my preferred title, is a highly melancholic and somewhat realistic story. It's not the typical royalty manhwa where the main character is highly talented and unique that she was able to fight obstacles that came in her way on the new world she finds herself in. No. Shuli may be brilliant but it was made apparent that she can't handle the issues concerning nobility alone. She had to rely on others in order to get over whatever obstacle that came in her and her family's way. And that is what I think that makes this story \"somewhat realistic\". There are so much we could do on our own, but there's even more that we could do surrounded by the people we trust and love. Her hardships don't feel foreign and at times, feel oddly familiar. It's melancholic at the same time as you can really feel the sadness and disorder every character feels whenever something goes wrong. A Stepmother's Märchen is a great story. It's like being trapped in an endless, dark maze, where every small leeway gave you enough motivation to keep going and watch over Shuli's journey. I make it sound really depressing but it's also really wholesome to see her family, despite a 'fake' one, develop full of love and affection. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're in for some nobility social warfare and some kinda heavy drama, then you're in for a great ride. Pretty messy and long review but I hope I was able to convey my intent."}, {"score": "9", "content": "Girl/Woman fixing her past mistakes which led to a broken and disconnected family. I'm sure anyone with a dysfunctional family can relate to the plot and find something in there for them.

The conflicts in the story weren't the most like deep, complex, or moving, but they kept me entertained and helped further develop the main cast, as a conflict should. For example, the girl's family are greedy and continually ask for money. ... However, there is a pretty interesting love development with the crown prince brewing that should be a decent conflict in the future.

Do not let the somewhat unconventional plot fool you, its an excellent piece of literature. People feel like people with motivations, desires, and misunderstandings. Politics handles like how politics should be. There are no clear allies but there is also no clear enemies. Society and Morality, not a dull thing in this manhwa. It will handle serious topics with the gravity it deserves but it also does not shy away from the joys of everyday life. The stakes are high because everything is on the line, made exceptionally clear by the little things. This is not just your ... everyday manhwa. While the MC got a second chance, she is not omnipotent - and her past life quickly becomes useless in predicting the future. She is smart but vulnerable. A human who understands her position and values the duty placed upon her unwillingly - despite the great pressure. 10/10 especially in character writing."}, {"score": "9", "content": "TL; DR This is a historical drama with hints of future romance, bound to b(l)oom in the later seasons. There is a lot of comedy and sweet moments, with a dash of serious political intrigue and dark moments later on. Pacing-wise, this is a slow burn experience with a lot of healing, meme-like humor, and pleasant character exploration. The author wisely decided to take their sweet time to work on emotional relationships, so when gut-punching comes you bet it's gonna hurt. Plus, I adore the female MC, which is a rare occurrence for a romance genre. She is written with a notable understanding of how ... women can have many sides to their personalities. Also, her more romantic side doesn’t rule her life or the logic behind her decisions (rare, right?). To conclude, this manhwa managed to surprise me and make me excited again for the romance genre. Enjoyment - 10 Summary. The setting is vaguely mid 19th century Germany. Shuli, the matriarch of the Neuwanstein family, a stepmother of four, and a favorite subject of gossiping nobles finally makes good on her husband’s dying wish. Her oldest stepson is getting married, thus making him the new head of the powerful family. However, due to estrangement from her stepchildren, she is rudely asked not to attend the ceremony. Full of regrets and pain, Shuli leaves everything in pursuit of freedom and happiness. At the next moment, she miraculously wakes up on the morning of her husband's death, seven years prior. With no way back, she embraces the opportunity to live this new timeline differently. Since she is now a more mature person (23) in a young girl's body (16), her new goal is to be a more emotionally present mother and to live to attend her son's wedding day. Shuli is a character I have a lot of feelings and respect for. Essentially, she is a child robbed of her childhood. As a young girl, Shuli was forcibly married to a wealthy widower who entrusted her with the protection of his children, treasures, and political power until his oldest son reaches adulthood. Out of duty, she does it all while surviving in the world of adults and being barely older than kids she swore to protect. In the new timeline, we follow her transformation from a withdrawn and always on defense girl to a more emotionally open and confident young woman. Not to spoil anything, but stepchildren are also written very well. Aside from the understandable cold greeting, their slight rudeness towards her in the past is acceptably explained very early. Keep in mind that they are motherless and fatherless kids, jet unable to properly express their feelings, just as Shuli was. That makes some ending parts of the season emotionally devastating when you see how misunderstandings can keep people apart and in the end estrange them forever. (No, I am not going to cry). If I had to say something bad about the whole experience, that would probably be that the first few chapters have too much humor in them and thus spend too little time on more important things like the current state of the family and the country. Letter chapters do get better in balancing serious and funny while showing us POVs of other characters, so these things tend to go away. The main villain also feels underdeveloped, but I think that is because the main obstacle of this season was the characters themselves, not something external. Context and design-wise, don’t expect historical accuracy. Everything seems like it’s pulled from different periods to make for an aesthetically pleasant and dramatic read. Likewise, manhwa isn't too focused on the complex of political intrigue, but we do get some good scheming and ok broad strokes of global politics. Art is gorgeous, with some occasional jaw-dropping panels."}, {"score": "8", "content": "When I first started reading I though it'd be a lot more generic than what I got. I thought there'd be some handsome shining knights, some back stabby revenge plan and a lot of befriending everyone. In a sense, I got some of that, but it deviates a good enough amount to make it truly enjoyable. The central focus point is actually completely non related to the otome game manga's. It's mostly about family, growing up and the hardships of high society (this one is actually often used). The villains aren't particularly well written, the opening chapters were quite boring, the characters were being cliche sometimes ... and the story would slow to a crawl at times. It isn't perfect, not even close. But the art, the small hints that the characters still are quite child-like, the moments of simple character interaction and the scenes which have really pretty art makes it stand out quite a bit. It's much more akin to a slice of life manga more than anything. If you really like more emotionally focused manga, it might be for you. At least, if you can forgive the excessive amounts of tropes and small mistakes for the pleasure of reading some really good scenes."}, {"score": "8", "content": "Pre-timeskip story: acceptance, adolescence, motherly love and a newfound family. Heartwarming, cute, very precious, best oi I ever read. 10/10 Post-timeskip story: romance, drama that does not matter, the most lovable character fl is content and gets less screen time, very very generic. 5/10 WARNING: I've avoided spoiling plot points, only commenting on the overall story structure but you might want to stop here if you want to go in knowing nothing. Fantasy of a Stepmother is not the first manhwa that shifts its focus and becomes average as a result, but damn I was surprised. Given how strong it started, I was almost certain the author ... would stick with the unique and original themes it excelled at instead of trying to be like everyone else which it did. The beginning chapters are incredible, we see a broken girl trying to mend a broken relationship with her adopted children. The FL is strong, selfless, cute, the side characters feel like they exist not only for her sake, overall the manhwa was a breath of fresh air from the cheap romantic otome isekai trash I've been reading recently. The story picks up around chapter 30 when one of her adopted family members is put on trial, and culminated for me during 57-65 with Shuri's heartbreaking backstory of misunderstandings which I won't spoil. It was unfathomable to me how the author could write such a creative, sympathetic and relatively plot-hole-free-ish (don't think too much) concept and then drop the ball... Welp, chapters 65-90 featured a timeskip, and the manhwa became the romantic otome isekai I've been reading recently. Granted it was not cheap, I was still invested but nothing happens in 25 chapters, there's some insinuations of an incestous development, which god I hope won't happen, overall the female lead is pretty happy and thus stakes are zero. I felt the post-timeskip arc was pointless, because the time that was skipped was the initial goal itself. After that, there's romantic rivalries, pointless family drama, some sword/hunting competition but even if war breaks out everyone dies I don't care since the family has already struggled and prevailed. Beyond that we have A Before Midnight 2013 moment, a hollow attempt at fabricating a family ordeal, and reliving past romance. In conclusion, do read Fantasy of a Stepmother for chapters 1-65, I gave them a 10/10 (understand I'm quite stingy, and elitist). I think the author should have not done non-familial romance altogether, extended the struggle prior to the time skip, adding 3-4 political/family arcs before the trial, and ended with an epilogue after the time skip but eh, I'm still very grateful for getting to experience the story as it is. I stand behind what I said in the intro, chapters 1-65 are the best of manhwa I have read. Going forward, I don't think the story has and will reach such heights again, but I shall be waiting and hoping to be proven wrong."}, {"score": "10", "content": "It is one of the best drama ever been created, anyone who gives this 8/10 or lower is not valid and should be banished. Emotionally Suffocating is the best way I can describe this masterpiece of art, having to watch Shuri going through her life as a single young stepmother in a world where a single miss-step could cause everything to crumble. The incredible plot writing showcases the everchanging unexpected future. The ethereal majestic art perfectly brings out the emotions, the mood, and the ambiance that makes me feel as if I'm there witnessing it 1st hand. The realistic remarkable character writing and their growth ... as a person, their struggles, the ups and downs and fighting against it with their all, the mesmerizing love story and the complicated interpersonal relationships, every little detail and all the ups and downs along with the excellent character writing of the antagonist; each and everything about it overwhelms me with utter intensity. Everything plays out with utmost perfection. And not to mention this story makes me feel like I'm not just a reader but a bystander in the very story while overseeing everything taking place before my very eyes. I can empathize with them without even realizing it. Also if there 1 thing about this series that's unique to it, it keeps the focus pretty much on the level of what the characters realistically get to deal with, the power struggle between the church, the nobles, and the royal family. It doesn't have a random plot where Shuri rescues a random NPC who then becomes her undying servant, cures the pandemic, or wipes out a secret cult in one go because that's not what she's trying to do. Throughout the story, Shuri makes choices for her family, her people, and possibly also for herself after taking each possible consequence that may come or how her choices might end up with people who she can't afford to offend. And I'm glad she made those choices, not specifically because they are the right choices but because they are something that will have very realistic consequences. Which in turn makes all the readers anticipate and look forward to what's to come next while also not getting rid of the anxiety that comes with it. The only gripe I have is that it's currently on hiatus for Season 3, i have never felt sooooo angry at a hiatus before this😡😡😡.... yes they need rest but please don't be away for long...

I recommend it to fans of the genre, with the caveat that it is very slow. So slow that I ended up dropping it at chapter 91. It is good. With the gorgeous artstyle, the expressive scenes and a multifaceted storyline, I can not deny that, but it is not for me. ▶Story: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The story is set in an alternate reality/history Holy Roman Empire sometime ... between the 1500 and 1700. It is refreshing how well researched the author is on the historical setting. It follows a time regressed (She died and woke up years in the past with her memories of the future) lower class girl who has to take on the role of mother to 4 children of nobility. She is too young for the role and the story is about her and her allies trying to navigate a hostile political landscape. The story is far from shallow, but the author is quite up front about wanting the story to have a heartwarming tone. Which means that you might feel a lack of tension even during the more serious chapters. ▶Characters: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ All the main characters are more than two dimensional and are given the opportuniy to grow throughout the story. Their beliefs and problems are realistic and portrayed well. While not everyone is likeable, they are at least understandeable. ▶Romance: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As the Manhwa focuses on a child raising other children as their mother, it has little time for romance. This does change as the story progresses, but much of the romance will come off as problematic to our modern sensibilities. The Manhwa does not try to defend its problematic parts though, and does present them as wrong. ▶Artwork: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When the artist does their best, this manhwa has some of the best and most detailed artwork out of any comic I have read. For most of the comic however, the art is fairly good, and serves the story well during emotional and expressive scenes."}, {"score": "4", "content": "Plot FL is sold by her mother to a noble for marriage. The noble is terminally ill, and wants FL to take care of his territory until the eldest son reaches adulthood and takes over as heir.

Just before she can finally retire by letting the eldest son takeover, she is murdered and regresses back to the time of her husband's funeral. She decides to do things better this time and build a loving family. Review The story revolves around FL and her desperate efforts to protect her family from ... other greedy nobles. This makes her children realize how great of a mother she is and they all become a wholesome family. It is mostly a heart-warming slice of life, with some occasional drama. Unlike other OI, FL is not some genius or girlboss. She relies on others and the rest of the cast support her. The art is great. Although, I just cannot see our FL as hot. Her character design looks childish. I like the overall plot and the vibe. The series has a great start too, with some nice metaphors. But I hate the pacing of this series. Everything moves at a snail's pace. This makes the story boring, because there's very little happening at any given moment. I read two seasons (137 chapters), but it feels like I read only 80 chapters worth of actual plot. The characters are interesting in terms of their personalities, but take a LONG time to actually *do* anything. The characters have motivations and *should* act, but they don't. I am honestly tired of reading this. So, I would not recommend this to anyone. There may be bad manhwas out there, but I would rather be reading them than this boring series."}]}

Unleashed, Jeong embarks on a killing spree that earns him the name \"Slaughtering Scythe Demon\" (鎌殺鬼). After his capture and imprisonment, a stroke of luck introduces him to a noble from the Mok Sword Family (然木劍莊) who looks identical to him. Offered freedom as the noble's body double, Jeong(正) immediately kills the young lord and coerces the bodyguard into compliance, beginning his journey to becoming the founder ... of the first Heavenly Demon Cult. Review This manhwa isn't for the faint of heart or those with strong moral sensibilities. What sets it apart from others in the genre is the absence of sci-fi elements or regression plots—there's no nano-technology or time-travel abilities, just raw talent and psychological cunning explained thoroughly in the early chapters. The narrative tension comes not from wondering if Jeong(正) will survive—readers familiar with the timeline already know he becomes the legendary founder of the Heavenly Demon Cult—but from witnessing his dark, calculated transformation into that infamous figure. If you appreciate morally complex protagonists and don't mind extreme edge in your storytelling, this manhwa offers a fascinating psychological study of villainy and the birth of a legendary cult. However, those seeking heroic protagonists or traditional moral arcs should probably look elsewhere"}, {"score": "7", "content": "The most important thing to understand right off the bat is that this story is edgy. That being said, it's pretty entertaining. The protagonist is a total psycho who is gifted with 100% OP talent/powers from the start. \"But OP characters are so boring!\" you say. I disagree. The problem with your generic OP character is that they are generic, not that they are OP. Fortunately, the protagonist here is actually unique, and the story is told within an engaging setting with solid world-building so far. The character of the protagonist keeps things interesting because their goals and strategies are going to be different from ... what you'd normally find in a cookie-cutter power fantasy story. \"But I hate edgy characters!\" The protagonist isn't just some normal dude who got isekai'd and suddenly started enacting a 12 year old's idea of a revenge fantasy. No. The protagonist here is actually pretty psycho, and the brutality + intelligence of his tactics and manipulations feels \"real\" rather than merely being artificially hyped by the story. Granted, the writer does still throw in some of those stereotypical \"t-that's impossible!\" moments, as if the protag hasn't consistently proven how great he was 10x already, but it doesn't really bring down the story much. The aesthetic of this story is also really nicely done. When I say \"aesthetic\" I don't just mean the art in terms of the quality of the visuals. What I'm talking about here is the actual style - the character designs, the scenery, the outfits, the way magic is actually shown, etc. I'm not someone who tends to care a whole lot about art quality so long as the story is good and the art is good enough, so for me to have thought \"I need to note the aesthetic in my review\" means this stuff must be well-above average. As for the side characters - they're fine. Ironically, despite the story being 53 chapters in, it feels like it's still quite \"young\" because the protagonist has been so entirely dominant and the world has been built out so much that there's a lot of potential yet to be explored. I'm withholding primary judgement here, but none of the side characters are annoying or anything like that, and I'd say they're interesting enough to care a bit about, there's just not THAT much care yet. \"So you hyped it up, why did you only rate it a 7?\" I rated it a 7/10 because that's my default \"solid\" rating for a story that I enjoy. A 7 actually isn't bad at all - and I'd definitely recommend this story to anyone who is interested in the premise. There's clearly a large vision behind this work, but we are still early. Could this eventually turn into an 8, 9, maybe even a 10? Sure, but it's way too early for me to make that judgement.

For those who don't care how dark a protagonist proves to be, it's a work that keeps obscurity above a protagonist with strong moral values. The dark and slightly comical tone brings a dissociation ... with Nano machine, however, it is a good thing, as is a work that maintains its originality even as a prequel."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Killer Concept: The story follows Jeong, a seriously wicked Slaughtering Scythe Demon who loves to kill.

And clearly it paid off seeing his legacy in Nano Machine. Characters 7/10: Honestly, a weakpoint for this series, since Mok doesnt ... really care to make relationships. Best we got is Blue spirit for consistent companionship (and thats okay with me, shes best girl after all). Theres also the new opponent obstacle every mini arc? Sometimes they return which is neat but mainly serve to show off MC's power gap. Blue spirit is the main talking point as she has the most narrative significance given her backstory and ties to the cult MC wants to take down. Probably the most equal footing relationship MC has or will have, which is interesting given his demeanor to everyone else. Not much to say about other spirits or peers besides Mok's younger brother. Interesting to see their relationship twist over the major arcs of the story. Hes been built up as an opposing force for about half the series so far? Art 9/10: Amazing. Really detailed and expressive. Fits with the whole occult and martial arts happenings. Plot: The overarching plot is a revenge quest and every major arc is a step closer, so bravo, good pacing. However the one major complaint is how fast MC gets stronger. The power gap is getting enormous and well, if you're interested in the series, you kinda just have to accept how much of a prodigy MC is?

{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/163877/Virtual_Strangers", "reviews": [{"score": "8", "content": "If you're interested in reading a lighthearted, fun manhwa with a good balance of MMORPG gameplay and BL romance and with zero toxicity and annoying drama, this is it. Now to start things off, for those mainly interested in the romance, I'm going to first point out the main element that may negatively factor into whether or not you will enjoy this manhwa: the main leads are dense and take a while to figure out each other's real identities - that they're actually a couple in the MMORPG they play. Due to a past experience, Jigu, the male love interest, is strikingly paranoid about having stalkers. ... After the protagonist, Yeo-woon, moves in next door to Jigu, a series of coincidental meetings and misunderstandings begin to pile up between the two that lead Jigu into mistakenly believing that Yeo-woon is a stalker. This can be incredibly funny and/or incredibly frustrating to the reader, as through their many meetings and interactions in-game and in real life, there are numerous hints and coincidences that signal that they're the same people that are going out in-game. Yet they somehow don't notice. Well, to be slightly more specific - 35 chapters in and one seems to have suspected so but the other still seems to be completely clueless. Because of this, the romance is a slow burn. There's also quite a bit of focus on the characters playing the game rather than what happens outside of it, although the amount of screentime between the in-game and real life worlds seem to become more balanced as the story progresses. It seems like it's going to take a long while for the main leads to meet up in real life (as shown to eventually happen based off of the first chapter) and develop romantic feelings for each other. On to the positives. The story is relatively simple and light-hearted, but the characters are likeable and the comedy is great. Yeo-woon is very friendly and nice and does a good job at fending for himself in-game despite playing like a newb. He acts slightly more mischievous in-game than in real life, but Jigu is the one who really shines when it comes to having a contrasting personality between the two worlds. Jigu is an annoying little shit in-game, but as the story progresses, he becomes a lovable little shit. His cutesy appearance and behavior in-game paint a funny, stark contrast to how he is in the real world: a buff man with an intimidating look but is a first-class tsundere. The other characters are likeable as well, many of them being other members of the same guild as the main leads who like to help Yeo-woon and enjoy watching the drama that unfolds between the two main leads. Despite the slow burn, the two main characters have good chemistry both in real life and in-game and play off of one another well. They start off on the wrong footing, but the development in their relationship seems to be very organic and not too rushed/slow. This manhwa does a particularly excellent job at handling the realism of playing MMORPGs. The game seems to be based off of Maplestory - there are cute chibis used as avatars for leveling up, grinding, crafting, jobs/classes, parties, NPC quests, chat features, trades, guilds, guild/couple events, PVPs, etc. Players often use abbreviations such as lmaooo or use emoticons or like to smack talk/taunt other players. The art is nothing too spectacular compared to other manga/manhwa, but it's still good and the in-game character chibis are extremely adorable. TL;DR If you love: - Gamers & enemies to lovers trope - Simple, lighthearted, fun BL - Slow burn - Oblivious guy x tsundere/blushy guy - MMORPGs - Stark contrast between real life/in-game personalities (Yeo-woon: friendly but oblivious and shows interest in Jigu irl, often weirded out by Jigu's in-game character and not particularly interested in getting too close to anyone in-game; Jigu: a tsundere and wary of Yeo-woon irl, playful and clingy with Yeo-woon in-game) - Anticipation for online to real life identity reveal - Cute in-game character chibis - Wholesome and funny in-game interactions and if a bunch of coincidences and misunderstandings piling up while waiting the long game for the main leads to discover one another's identities/start dating in the real world won't bother you (much), give this manhwa a read."}]}
{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/113555/Kings_Maker", "reviews": [{"score": "1", "content": "\"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS\" Chapter 23 and 24 killed this piece of work so hard. I don't even know how to explain this, but I'll try: I'll go straight to the point, its not about just being fucked up. I've read and seen worse, but its so poorly written that I felt disgusted and very uneasy. Without getting into specifics, King is a pedo and he has a particular chamber for his doings with his children harem. Its a fucked up place, full of toys for children, drugs and wine that he offers to his victims. There is obviously rape - and extreme violence afterwards with ... another victim, then suddently romance between the protagonist and the victim that is younger than 15. Ladies and gentleman, you don't greet a rape victim by furiously kissing him/her or being sexual at all, imagine doing so the minute after the victim has experienced the trauma. The BL isn't even worth it. Don't waste your time, there's not a good plot nor charming characters with interesting backstory other than simple trauma."}, {"score": "9", "content": "“King’s Maker” first drew me in with its bright & shiny artstyle. The story is about a lost prince returning to avenge the people that we loves and to correct the wrongs of his father. What can I say, this story has everything that I look for in a medieval drama: Story (8/10) ✅ adorable romance = but at the same time it doesn’t overwhelm the plot. ✅ intriguing revenge plot = right when you think that it's \"by the numbers\" they throw a curve-ball at you. Art (10/10) ✅ Colorful but Intimidating = to capture the dazzling & grandiose appearance that covers-up the twisted power. Character (8/10) ✅ ... political struggle = MC fighting a uphill battle make connections. ✅ legitimate frustrating angst = the MC learning to jump through hoops to get to his goals. ✅ corrupt monarch = the king's obsession distracts him from his duties and makes him a more disliked character. Enjoyment (10/10) ✅ hints of humor = to lighten up the mood of all this angst and drama. If there is anything to dislike about the story, it would be the King’s pedophilia, but that is part of both the characters' and the audience’s hatred toward him. Also if you're wary of mature themes like blood and sexual themes, I suggest that you read with caution, but it's not too overwhelming Aside from that, it a good story of mind games with a side of BL romance. And now is a good time to catch up on it since the 2nd season hasn’t been posted yet in English. But from what I've glanced at, it’ll expand on the aftermath of this season in great ways."}, {"score": "10", "content": "The strongest point of King's Maker is probably it's story line, which is cliché yet unique. Who wouldn't enjoy some drama around the throne? But this time there are no maids or high-born ladies dangling around the main prince, but the king's boytoy. He is also the one who is determined to make the said prince king, instead of some power-hungry mom. The story is well-paced with it's ups (climaxes/highlights) and downs (relaxing/funny moments). The writer is able to tell the story without rushing it in 37 chapters, and make the reader hold their breath every page. The story starts with Wolfgang Goldenleonard, the 4th prince ... of his kingdom, being taken into the palace after having lived outside for years. He despises the palace and his father and refused any interactions untill he met Shin. Shin is one of the 'children' aka boytoys of the king (Wolfgang's father), and he shares Wolfgang's disgust for the current kingdom. Shin wants to change it, and he plans to do that by making Wolfgang the king. The characters all have their unique parts, and the main characters undergo character development. The romance between Wolfgang and Shin is slow as to not lesson our focus on the main story, but fast enough for the reader to notice their feelings for each other early on. The art is out of this world. The artist really has their own style, which is stunning and not basic. There's no such thing as too much gold!!! Sometimes I'm fangirling purely bc of the art."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Look, I don't normally write reviews or rate anything a 10. But King's maker definitely deserves it. Yes it's not some authentic masterpiece that blows away your mind, but it's very close to that. At first I refused to read King's maker since I thought it was just another annoying BL manhwa without any context or plot to it. But nevertheless I gave it a chance after eyeing it for a bit and boy I did not expect what was about to be shoved in my face. (This is a pretty long review btw) Let's start with the story. I honestly thought I was going to drop it ... but I just couldn't stop reading. Though it isn't something outstanding that you'd never expect, it had no plot holes and the plot was simply well formed. I found myself so immersed in the whole thing that I couldn't put my phone down and I read it until 6 in the morning. It made sense and wasn't too overwhelmed by the romance. It was very well balanced, especially for a BL manhwa. Art Ah yes, the art. The art was absolutely beautiful. It isn't anything too memorable but it's certainly stunning. The anatomy was correct at all times (It was so perfect to the point that the artist remade the whole drawing since the ear was too big). And the element of the gold in king's maker is really something to remember and admire, it really gives it a nice touch. Characters There's not much to say but first, the villain. Man I love that they didn't give him a sad backstory to justify his actions. He was just so well made and explained that whenever I think of a good villain I think of the king from king's maker. Lastly, the protagonist. I really liked the character development with him. He learned to go through fires to reach his goal and I enjoyed that about him. Enjoyment I like the fact that they added some comedic effect to tone down the angst and drama in the manhwa. It's very well balanced and it wasn't too overbearing. Overall I give it a 10/10 I loved king's maker so much. Yes it isn't perfect, but then again when have you ever read a perfect manhwa? It all comes down to opinions anyways. Great, beautiful art, likeable and well made characters, completely worth it. Sounds like a 10 to me. Content warning. One last thing. This manhwa is not for everyone. It's not some cute and wholesome manhwa you read to enjoy some fluff. Some people don't seem to understand that and full on hate on it. It has a fair amount of blood, mature themes, physical abuse, animal abuse, nudity, violence and sexual content. Not to mention the king is a pedophile. Again, not for everyone, but definitely worth a read. I highly recommend it."}, {"score": "9", "content": "9/10 First, about chapter 24, and that other review. *Spoiler* Shin comes out of the chambers of the pedophilic king and tells Wolfgang about it. At least it looks like it ad that chapter has no dialogue at all. Wolfgang then gives him a kissing mark. I think everyone was furious about the timing and whys they add romance at a moment like this. But it becomes clear that this was part of Shins plan to get thrown out of the chambers and lose his title as \"a kings child\". So please dont get discouraged by this as it was not meant to be a downplay of ... trauma, bur rather an important part of the story. I still agree they couldve been less bold about it but its still not as bad as it seemed at first. Also the protagonists and the \"younger than 15\" child are around the same age. The other review made it sound like the main couple was pedophilic too. Now the rest. The story is very interesting, and the romance between the protagonist is not really a focus of it since they're both children at the beginning. Its more of a political and emotional story than a \"BL\" story. The art is very nice, too !! Theres some heavy scenes with child death and gore. Mentions and talk about pedophilia and scenes showing aspects of it (nothing graphic though). So please know this before reading as it may be hard on some people. But generally it was nice, thrilling and intriguing. Im looking forward to the sequel and recommend reading it!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "Let me start off by saying that the King's Maker is one of best visual webtoons I've read. The art is truly wonderful as it takes you in a new era within a different time period. I was first captivated by the art alone before I'd finished chapter one. The setting and colours take you on an adventure. I loved how it has such a vibrant palette of reds, golds, and yellows as key tones throughout the manga. The story line is actually very interesting and beautiful story. It's the tale of a boy who is the missing fourth son of the Great King and ... is determined to becoming the next king but has to learn what it takes to be a royal and lead a nation. The only person who is willing to teach him is his new friend Soohyuk, who happens to be the king's \"favourite\" children. I will warn this story has moments that are not for the faint of heart as they surround children in an adult world and does have a reference to sexual assault. The characters are all wonderful and you really see them grow not only as individuals but with the relationships between each other. The main relationship we see blossom is between Wolfgang and Soohyuk. As they get older you see their relationshup grow and it just makes your heart like butter...ahhh!! This story was an absolute pleasure to read and I was captivated from start to finish. I praise the art which takes you on a journey. The characters together just add to story and the take your breathe away. It certainly took mine away. The King's Maker does have a second season and I highly suggest it if you enjoyed the first one."}]}
{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/166865/The_Extras_Academy_Survival_Guide", "reviews": [{"score": "9", "content": "9.2/10 As I am writing this review, I have just binged 79 chapters in one day, and it is currently 3:21 a.m. Now, that might be because I'm a psychopath who has nothing else to do with my life other than reading manga and manhwas, but I'd like to think that it serves as a testament to how good this manhwa is. Let me get this straight: this manga is VERY GENERIC. Or... that's what it should be, but it's not. Admittedly, my expectations were unfair for this manhwa due to it having a higher rating than my favorite and unique \"S Tier\" manhwas like \"Surviving The ... Game as A Barbarian\" or \"Infinite Mage,\" so I was quite disappointed when this story started as nothing more than a replica of the 100 other \"transported into the game as a villain/side character,\" seemingly with no difference in the introduction or the characters. To add to that, the storytelling was a bit odd--it was told like a novel with first-person perspective, so the worldbuilding and setting were built awkwardly with the mc narrating everything. With the added awkwardness, the chapters never connected, as they never started from the cliffhanger of the previous chapter, but it started at a flashback or some other plot point, adding to the confusion on how this manhwa would have an identity outside of its generic premise. Yet, the more I read of this story, the more I've become attached to it. These \"flaws\" almost became part of the story's uniqueness. But what truly differentiates this manhwa from the rest of its generic brothers is the pacing. I'll be the first to admit that I did not trust in this story's pacing at all, as numerous characters were introduced back to back in the introduction, and it seemed like the plot points were being rushed. I mean, usually, \"game\" manhwas would spend 20 or 30 chapters to completely flesh out a \"game-ending\" arc, but this manga completed 5-6 arcs in a measly 30 chapters. Yes, 5-6 arcs. You'd think this would be a critical error in writing, as with all stories, since every plot point and character wouldn't have ample time to create a climactic mood, but somehow and someway this story defies all odds. The chapters are incredibly long, and due to how many \"climaxes\" there are in the story, there is ZERO filler or boring moments. Every bit of it is fun to read. And oh boy, does this story know how to make a climax/resolution. Every arc has felt unique, and the endings to the arcs are all memorable and attention-grabbing. And though I previously bashed on the story's storytelling, the storytelling truly finds an identity by being subtle but direct. There is no great way to describe it, but it is unbelievable how complete the story feels despite having so few chapters to work with. As for the characters... I could go on and on about every specific character in this manhwa, as that's how good they are. They come off as a bit cliche initially -- you have your stoic mc who doesn't want to interfere with the game's mc, the multitude of heroines, the antagonists that become friends, etc, etc. But, despite their common archetypes, the plot expands on their personalities through a slow burn. There have been some characters that were introduced by the fifth chapter, and only until fifty or so chapters later do they truly shine. You'd think that's lazy writing, but these \"neglected\" characters were constantly tied into the storyline, and were gradually exposed to the readers before having their time to shine. Because of this, no character truly feels rushed, and they all carry their own emotional impact. Heck, I unknowingly teared up when a villain died for no reason at all. I just felt like I should be crying, and I did. Some of you may already know me for being an absolute sucker for romance in stories, as that genre is my speciality, and this manhwa completely blew me away. Countless times, action mangas/manhwas add a romantic subplot with a heroine or a multitude of them just for the sake of having them. These heroines usually aren't developed or introduced well, and the romance suffers drastically because of it, as the connection to the audience nor the main character feels genuine. Yet, I'm left puzzled. Why and how is the romance/female leads so much better in this story than 99% of the romance mangas I've read? It's honestly baffling. EVERY single heroine has left a memorable impression and has been developed countless times. It's one thing to do it for one female lead, but to do it for a harem is absurd. And that absurdity is this manga. The drama, the wholesomeness, the way the heroines fell in love with the mc -- they are all top-tier and smooth. If you removed the action from the story and left the story with just a harem romance, this could even be considered the best harem story of all time. ....Aaand just like that, I've yapped for much longer than I should about how good this manhwa is, and now it's 3:53 a.m. I'm going to head to bed now, and I do hope you give this manhwa a try. It is a slow and awkward five chapters in the beginning, as it starts off generic, but it really does pick up and grow on you the longer you read. Good night, and have a good time reading this masterpiece. You guys know this is just my opinion, right? Reading Rankings (Portnoy inspired + A Huang-Teizan Original) 10 - God’s penmanship 9 - Must-read. Drop everything else. 8 - Instant bookmark 7 - Entertaining 6 - Good to pass time 5 - Why are you reading this? 4 - Bad. 3 - Typical garbage. 2 - My head hurts. 1 - Retirement is a thought. 0 - “Did they even give you a story?!”"}, {"score": "3", "content": "Just read [Demon King of the Royal Class] instead of this. its better in every way (in my opinion ofc) I thought this manhwa would be interesting because it heavily reminded me of that other manhwa, but 20 chaps in and Im starting to hate this the more I think about it. So heres my rant. The description: I possessed a third-rate extra villain character in my favorite game. I have no ambitions, and I just want to live a quiet life. (Ed has every opportunity to leave and distance himself from the story) But sheesh, this world is a hard place to survive in. I will survive ... to the ending of this story, in a way the protagonist cannot. I will survive in the way of a third-rate villainous character. (By the end of the first arc, everyone likes him or at least no longer hates him, so what villian is he really?) Art: The art is decent, pretty standard style of shounen manhwas. My problem with it though is the paneling and aesthetics; There are barely any creative paneling, or rather, only the most stiff and boring paneling exists. Theres either the borderless spread page, or a large, centered block panel, barely anything else, which wouldve helped with fights especially. (ex. when Ed fights the rabbit, it looks like the rabbit was being useless and let him shoot its master, when really Ed dodged its attack and made the shot, something a closeup panel wouldve helped clarify) My other problem is the video game aesthetics, this is a videogame isekai, so no suprise they exist, but its as if the manhwa almost forgets. SO FAR, there have been only TWO instances of Ed's stats page , NO character menu shown of anyone else, and the only thing that reminds the artist to include the video game UI are the items that get shown a couple times randomly every arc (NOT THAT IT MATTERS BECAUSE THERES NO WORLD BUILDING AND THUS NO SIGNIFICANCE, which ill rant on later) Characters: They're all pretty boring. I liked Janica in the first arc, AND THEN SHE GOT STRIPPED OF ALL AGENCY AND REDUCED TO A MINDLESS LOVE INTEREST. The manhwa has a habit of exposition dumping/ introducing new characters to move the plot, which ends up turning everyone into a plot device. The biggest perpetrator of this is Lucy, the top magic student, who is the deus ex machina of the first arc. Oh so this great mage gets introduced as OP but sleeps all the time, she sleeps in Ed's camp randomly despite being afforded a dorm, a pretty cheap way of forcing them to interact/ be friends. The climax of the first arc has a dragon that has a shield nobody in the main party can break. But because Ed played the game he knows exactly where Lucy would be sleeping (even though canonically in the video game shes supposed to not be involved in the first chapter so how does he know?) and gets her to break it. While im at it, I'll point out how Ed \"the worst student in the magic faculty\" Rothtaylor cut the dragons neck clean off with a basic skill in one try. Phoenia was cool, I liked her in the first arc, TOO BAD SHES GONE FOR MOST OF THE SECOND ARC. Taylor, the original protag, is a huge plot device, with no personality of his own. He just serves to drive the plot, since he HAS to be the one following the story, the manhwa is just Ed setting up everything else for Taylor to complete. Taylor's childhood friend- who? she does nothing at all Lorthelle was meh, her setup in the first arc was interesting, especially since it created a interesting dynamic with Janica, being omniscient essentially and watching her try to recruit Ed. Too bad the exposition dumps made her story confusing. The MC Ed, is bland and uncompelling. Whats his goal? Why is he doing all of this? Hes like a Gary Stu, how he easily earns his achievements. Again, he is presented was the worst student, but after what? living outdoors for a month? Hes suddenly got \"high magic proficiency\" For abilities like \"ignition\" and \"windblade\" to instantly set an entire room on fire and cut metal chains, Ed sure earned his proficiency by lighting campfires? and cutting wood? No stakes for him, and nothings a challenge. Story: Its like the author is making stuff up along the way, no, even if he did, the pacing would be smoother. For example, Ed earns the ability to make a spirit contract during the first arc climax, so why doesnt he form a contract after the arc is over? (is he stupid?) I like how after the first arc destroys the school the second arc immediately returns to tearing up the school, with little downtime. Theres no school/ class plot, which is fine but would've better developed character relations and I'd like to see them interact since SOME CHARACTERS JUST MEET ED \"THE RUMOURED ROTTEN EVIL GUY\" Rothtaylor for the first time and immediately decide to befriend him. *cough* Jikks, Janica, Jikks GF *cough* Jikk's does have a good reason to like Ed but he really flipped his opinion of him 180 degrees within minutes. BY THE END OF THE FIRST ARC EVERYONE LIKES HIM SO WHY DID THE AUTHOR SET HIM UP TO BE DISLIKED IN THE FIRST PLACE IF IT BARELY MATTERED!?! NONE OF THIS RELATIONSHIPS WOULDVE BEEN AFFECTED. AT LEAST SAVE IT FOR THE END OF THE FIRST SEASON There is no reason why Ed lives in the forest, Janica's maid, the one who kicked Ed out of the dorms no longer hates him, in fact has shown favor towards him, and he is still a student at the academy, so it makes no sense why he shouldn't be offered residency. I noticed theres a lot of exposition in the second arc, almost like the lines suit a novel format better, which makes me think this is just a bad adaptation. Some lines would make more sense as a thought bubble but its just a paragraph of narration. About worldbuilding, yeah, it doesnt exist. The world is limited to the school lmao. 'we cant introduce the outside! It would be too hard to explain why Ed chooses to stay at the school instead of living a commoners life in town, yknow, like the quiet life he says he wants in the DESCRIPTION??' Phoenia introduces the existence of corrupt nobility? TOO BAD! we arent gonna explore that because its outside the school! Lortelle has a evil merchant king boss as a guardian and drama from the fact he killed her bio dad? Oh we'll just make him come to the school to settle that drama! No need to explore outside the school! Oh Jikks comes from a wild tribe? Oh Janica introduces the existence of spirits? Oh the Rothtaylor family is large and actually corrupt? LETS EXPLORE NONE OF THESE Its like there was a checklist of archtypes the author wanted to complete and shoved all these characters haphazardly into this manhwa with half a thought allocated to each of them. 2nd arc: Oh... thats the beginning of a harem... Oh... Janica is gonna become a yandere... :/ Why is Alice an enemy? She betrayed Lorthelle, who was supposed to be the boss, so really isnt Alice just doing her job as head maid? And Lorthelle avoided any punishment, i guess nobody caught on that everything was her plan?

The parts I enjoyed the most were his interaction with side characters and building his base in the woods. Summary: Art- 7/10 The art is sometimes choppy and undefined. Face shapes are sometimes too plain. Pretty good overall but could be better, although it doesn't really influence reading comprehension much. Story - 6.5-7.5/10 ... The story is pretty cliche and similar to other stories I've read. His unique identity as Ed Rothstaylor and how he survived in the woods was a nice addition to the story. Character - 6.5-7/10 Character interaction was enjoyable but not realistic at times. The female characters' attraction towards him in the beginning seemed unnatural and forced by the author. This story is clearly a harem, so a word of caution. Pacing - 6.5/10 Pacing in my opinion was slightly too fast and awkward. His interaction with side characters sometimes felt unnatural and too unrealistic. Additional thoughts: I would have liked to see more interactions between his family, although I'm assuming that it will be addressed in the future. His woodworking and the wholesome moments between the female main characters are nice, but it lacks depth at times. Almost all the females that come into contact with him for more than a few chapters start liking him, which I feel is a bit too forced, although understandable since this is going to be a harem (or maybe our MC is too charming?) Rating - 7 A binge-worthy manhwa with plenty of wholesome moments. Visit my profile for more!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "I picked this manhwa up on a whim, because of lack of enough good anime junk food power fantasy in the current season to fill up my empty schedule. What I was not expecting is that this is not that junk of a food! Like, this is an actually compelling and believable story, set in an RPG game, with characters that possess depth, have their own arcs, thoughts and do their own things. They have agency, act unexpectedly, but believably and generally have their own part of the main story for themselves. I really liked that. It's great worldbuilding when more than one person can ... be an active and moving part of the plot. (Also, Klebius is best girl.) The premise itself is technically just a \"male akuyaku reijou\", but at the same time, it's one of the best ones that I had the chance to watch or read. Considering that Extra's Guide is similar in a few aspects to Mobuseka (Look it up. It's pretty good despite stinking of Shield Hero slightly), this is straight up \"just\" a story of rehabilitation, getting out of loneliness and learning to walk again after being stomped into dirt, but without the usual moral high ground of being the victim of the world. This is, at the same time, NOT a revenge story. This is at worst, a wholesome if a bit simple story of finding your worth. It's wholesome and inspiring. Another highlight I thought of, are the fights. They've so far been deeply tactical and dynamic, without falling on to a \"who can hit harder\" slugfest. The movements seem believable, without deus ex machina bullshit. I remember a particular fight, with one character stopping another, from pulling out a knife and disarming the assailant. It felt very realistic, as if taken from a self-defense guide. In Extra's Guide, when a fight appears and feels grandiose and amazing, then it simply is. Every firework is justified. This series makes it so easy to like it. The author goes the extra distance with fights and it shows. It's really good. I'll likely be glazing on this series for many months to come. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just ask you, the reader of this review, this small favour. Give Extra's Academy Survival Guide a chance. 71 chapters are out now, as I'm writing this.

I'll start this review out by saying this: if you think this is a bad story for xyz reasons, or just want to enjoy it in a different way, I heavily encourage you to read the LN. It doesn't have the flaws the Manhua falls for. We are at chapter 39 in the Manhua, LN + side stories are finished. Let's start with the good: Art: Easy 10/10. Some of the best art I've ever seen in a Manhua. When I initially picked up this Manhua at like chapter 25, ... I wasn't expecting such AWESOME scenes. Characters: 7/10. The more I dwell on this, I do realize there are some serious flaws with the characters. They're pretty bland, but at least they can effectively move along the plot without making it boring. I do hate on how a lot of characters are reduced to being Ed's 9th girlfriend. Yes, I know that as of right now there's only two (rn like four as of 65) characters actively pursuing him, but c'mon, we know there's more. Story: 8/10. The pacing of the actual story is fast, which I like, and I love how much filler where the characters get closer with each other. It is also stated on page 406 of the LN that the story had been severely fast-tracked, so there is mention of the story progression in the actual story. The story itself, while fun, can be pretty bland when you consider how overpowered our little forest noble can be when he tries for no reason. Yeah, I get that he's been training wind blade, but there was NO reason he should've been able to beat that thing, defense broken or not. There are some serious issues with the story, but it's fine if you're okay with issues. There's not really plot holes, I've tried to find them, but the story suffers from different issues. 9/10 from me. I'm slightly vegetablized so I can see past the flaws pretty easily. Alright, I wanna address some things I saw in another review. I would advise skipping this part unless you've finished the story, because here there be spoilers. *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. Worldbuilding doesn't exist. Yeah that's true, but we get a rough idea of what life is like outside of the island through Lortelle's Arc. 2. They won't explain why Ed doesn't choose to live a commoners life because it will ruin their main plot. They HAVE explained this. Graduating the school practically guarantees him an easy life, hence why he fights so hard to stay there. 3. Corruption of nobility concept being thrown away. In later chapters this is a HUGE point in the story, I'm not gonna bash you for not knowing that, it's mostly in the LN, but it's slowly getting adapted. 4. Lortelle's adoptive evil dad barely having any plot relevance. That's because he was a \"third-rate villain\", like Ed. Just a guy there to move the plot forward then die. He was intentionally made to not have plot relevance, and from the sounds of it, he gets more of it in this story than the actual game. 5. Jikks' tribe being introduced in his backstory, only to never be brought up again. They're probably all dead. I don't see them lasting that long without my goat Jikks. Besides, what are they going to do? There'd be literally no point to have them in the story. 6. Ed's family being super evil. Read some more of the story, this is extremely relevant and Ed's dad is one of the biggest villains in the series. Plus, they just introduced his little sister in the Manhua, who is there to make their father proud and get rid of Ed. All of these are some valid points that you may experience when reading it for the first time, but unfortunately a lot of them are addressed in the story."}, {"score": "7", "content": "Mad respect for the main character, Ed, in his desire to just survive and let the MC in the video game do all the hero saving things. He will step up when things have changed because of him, but he always tries to not get involved based on the fact he does not want to add more to his plate. Lucy is the best character in the fact that she is OP and all she wants is food (jerky) and sleeping. Like talk about bestie right there. If you ever need to find a good napping spot, she has got you covered. A draw back is how ... much harem vibes it gives. This is mostly from the rich girl, spiritualist, and a little bit from the princess. It does get annoying because Ed could not care less about romance. It can and has interrupted him from accomplishing his tasks which makes it frustrating to watch/read."}, {"score": "9", "content": "This was a manhwa i started because i was bored, but damn it was 100% worth it. First of all it is the only harem story that i actually liked a lot. It is very well executed and written in a way that you cant hate on a fmc for no reason. It is kinda annoying at first how the protagonist is trying to lay down as much as possible so the storyline doesn't change while he clearly see that him staying in school (the character he possessed is supposed to disappear from the academy and end up on the streets) has fucked up the storyline ... at a crazy level, though later on he realises that he have to step up and help the original cast get through the storyline points. The protagonist actually is unintentionally aura farming 24/7, like who is jin woo in front of him, which makes the manhwa more fun. When we say its a harem story don't think that he has 50 girls chasing him, 150 chapters in and there are 5 girls that like him and he recognises 3-4 of them. A fun thing is that the mc,that has beat the game a lot of times, uncovers things about the story that he was unable to see when he was playing as the protagonist of the game, that way we get some beautiful scenes. Overall i highly recommend it if you like a action/romance story. It actually has big chapters that can take up to 10 min to finish so each chapter really fills you up.

Without spoiling, i can say that they consent in everything and there is no rape or abuse. It's just a very beautiful manhwa that takes place in college and some of us might feel the atmosphere of this series more than ... others. It starts with our main character that studies a lot and hates slackers. We all know that even in college there are group projects and sometimes it might lead to pairs that have no connection at all. Same here, our main character gets paired with 3 slackers and he won't keep the fact that he worked by himself on the project and tells the teacher, which results to the other guys to fail.

Firstly I'd like to address the elephant in the room: is it explicit? The answer is not simple; while there are no lightsabers, it very obvious what shenanigans the couple are getting up to. Intimate scenes are tastefully drawn, leaving much to ones imagination. No excessive saliva, jizz or other bodily fluids depicted. Contrary to many of the BL tropes it is consensual, affectionate and have an equal share in sexual power. They are approximately the same age. There are no weird kinks. They practice safe, vanilla ... sex. Quite honestly, I found it wholesome in a genre that is rife with red flags, non-con and abusive power struggles. Sangwoo can easily be described as being on the autistic range. He is highly intelligent, is described as being OCD and appears to lack understanding of human emotions. His blunt and rather abrupt way of interacting with people can be interpreted as offensive. Jaeyoung on the other hand has highly developed social skills, is laid back and has a free spirit. He has anger issues, but is never abusive to his love interest. Their inevitable clash of personalities is entertaining. Their dialogue is witty and at times had me guffawing in laugher. The story is simple, a classic enemies to lovers narrative that takes place at college. It is typical slice of life, with romance being the focus. The beauty and magic is in the dialogue, the authentic wrestling with concerns regarding gay relationships, and Sangwoo's unwavering bluntness while dealing with discovering his sexual identity. There are no childish, 'giggle giggle, he touched my hand' moments. The artwork is full colour, webcomic style. While the illustration is generally good, I found at times it lacked the professional slickness of printed manga/manhuas. I may be overly critical, but I have become accustomed to high quality illustration, and being an illustrator myself, am more analytical about competent understanding of anatomy and portraits. There are some panels which look hurriedly drawn, with messy linework and inaccurate proportions. I am certain that the illustrator would agree with me that they could be reworked to improve overall quality. I will recommend this manhwa for the mature audience, without homophobia, and who are looking for a wholesome, funny love story. Know that you will be reading scenes that are erotic at times.

I've never thought of writing a review so far but I must say, this one deserves it!! THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING STORY. The characters, the story, the relationships, how they depict trauma, the understandings, THE FREAKING COMMUNICATION - everything is perfect! When I read romance Manhwa's, I hate, like HATE, dragged-ass misunderstandings. See, I like jealous MCs and stuff but (in most of the romance manhwa's) they are always so dragged out and insensible. I am a sucker for communication in relationships and this manhwa is just *a chef kiss*. There are some ... misunderstandings but they aren't prolonged and there is sufficient communication. The characters have so much depth to them and I love the way they (pretty much) accurately depict trauma and grief. The way the writer has used the concept of death is just marvellous. Death is portrayed from both angles - to whom it could be way too serious and those who take it as a matter-of-fact thing. This manhwa is not like the other re-birth/reincarnation manhwas. The approach taken to portray this concept is something that I haven't seen at all. Overall, it is a very good manhwa. It has a lot of depth to it and I really enjoyed reading it!! You'll must give it a try!!"}, {"score": "9", "content": "The short of it: A contemporary romance with a dash of supernatural dealing with themes of trauma and grief. See You In My 19th Life has very likeable characters and is able to fully develop the potential of its story and themes. If you want to read a romance that’s swoon-worthy but is also really smart and deals with heavier themes, I can’t recommend it enough. The long of it: I was a bit cautious when I started reading See You In My 19th Life because, although I had enjoyed Lee Hey’s previous work (A Good Day to Be A Dog), I was a bit disappointed by ... it, mostly because I thought it didn’t exploit the characters’ and story’s full potential, and some of the plot points felt like they were there to add drama and fill time rather than contribute to the story. With that said, I was immediately hooked by the characters and set up of See You, and I’m happy to report that my interest didn’t waiver throughout the story. You may read the synopsis of See You, maybe its first few chapters, and think you’ve already seen this plot a thousand times: a reincarnation romance? A main characters who is a genius because she lived several lifetimes? The male lead is the aloof heir to a rich corporation, whose thin glaze of coldness covers awkwardness and hurt? I’ve seen all these story beats elsewhere, but the way See You stands out is that it uses them really well, to the point where you barely even realize they’re clichés anymore I feel like Lee Hey’s deftness is that she really focused on the psychology of her characters. Seo-ha, our main lead, is aloof and emotionally stunted in a way that felt like a direct product of his education and the trauma he went through, which made him feel like a real person rather than an archetype. Ji-eum, on the other hand, really conveyed the impression of someone who has lived through several lives: a little devil-may-care, very playful, and smart. Oh God, is she smart! I feel like your average strong, intelligent female protagonist tend to ring pretty hollow because you don’t get to see her display those traits often, but Si-eum proves herself to be thoughtful and perceptive several times through the story. I also found her straightforwardness and the fact that she’s the one courting Seo-ha rather than the other way around very refreshing. I won’t go into details about other important characters, mostly because it takes a while for the story to really establish its main cast and I don’t want to give too much away. I’ll simply say that, although See You’s cast is pretty small, it’s also really solid; we get a few really well-rounded characters, and the others, although they are relatively one-note, didn’t feel like caricatures, which is enough for me. Like most romance stories, the plot hinges mostly on the lead character’s relationship, and it was thoroughly enjoyable and well-written. Seo-ha and Si-eum’s personalities played nicely off each other, and the added tension created by the fact that they’ve known each other for a long time but Seo-ha doesn’t know it was nicely explored. There are somewhat dark implications to what Ji-eum is doing – barging in the life of someone she hasn’t seen in twenty years, trying to get close to him while hiding an enormous secret from him – and the author wasn’t afraid to tackle them, while keeping it a light and idealistic romance story. The other plot threads were all pretty tightly woven together, and contrary to A Good Day to Be a Dog, it didn’t feel like they were added for drama’s sake alone, and were rather a continuation of the story’s universe. About the art: while it’s not necessarily special (I’ve seen more than a few Korean comics with a similar artstyle as Lee Hey’s) or breathtaking, it feels appropriate to the style of story being told, and it looked really nice and cute. Also, not to be shallow, but there are some really nice outfits in this comic. When I read the end of the story, I felt really proud of Lee Hey. I feel like she was able to really improve her writing and go beyond the limitations she had in her previous work, and it’s really wonderful to be pleasantly surprised by an author."}, {"score": "9", "content": "For someone who occasionally reads romance novels, but doesn’t seek them out, I was casually scrolling through webtoon when I came across this series and decided to give it a go.

{"link": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/111211/Cheese_in_the_Trap_Season_4", "reviews": [{"score": "7", "content": "Cheese in the Trap is the bowl of confusing, underwhelming, and unevenly-seasoned noodles you buy on a whim one evening after class and force yourself to finish because you did pay for it after all, even if it was only a few dollars, only to discover that all of the seasoning had gathered at the bottom of the bowl and that said seasoning is Actually Very Good even though there are maybe three noodle strands left in your bowl and not much left to do with it, and to leave the restaurant feeling inexplicably happy. In Cheese in the Trap, if it can be misread, it ... will be misread. If it can be misunderstood, it will be misunderstood. And if a woman and a man have a conversation with each other, they are in Love and it is everyone’s problem. The ratio of Named Characters Who Are Not A-holes to Named Characters Who Are A-holes is something like 1:7 and stays that way until the very end, and though most, if not all, of our protagonist’s harassers received holy retribution, the question that I left each bloody finale with was: what was the point of taking things so far? Several characters were established as freeloaders/gossips/stalkers/creeps fairly early on in the story. Most followed the same pattern. Offense —> telling-off —> offense —> telling-off —> offense —> telling-off —> offense —> everyone gets bored and stops paying attention to them. Prolonged suffering can be narratively interesting. But most of the suffering in Cheese in the Trap seemed to be for suffering’s sake. Things escalated until Seol, Jung, or someone else hit a breaking point. Is Cheese in the Trap a manhwa about breaking points? I think not. In other news, this manhwa features a bit of the classic ‘rich, popular dude meets poor, overworked girl’ scenario plus a healthy serving of interpersonal drama. While acknowledging that romcoms tend to be a form of escapism, the focus on what actions the individual can take instead of any influences or pressures on/from society still seemed like a missed opportunity. Being rich is presented as one of two things: a blessing or something that leads to emotional stunting and isolation from your peers. In this framework, Jung’s family can be seen as the personification of financial power. We are shown Jung’s suffering, his hurt, and his frustration, all of which was depicted in a harrowing, raw show of emotion, i.e. Jung’s life is hard because his family is too rich. However, Seol’s suffering, hurt, and frustration can all be chalked up to being too sensitive, too much of a workaholic, or too prone to anxiety, and she finds her peace in learning to relax into her circumstances and embrace the ups and downs. It does not seem to have occurred to the author that Seol’s life might also be hard because her family is too poor. The distribution of sympathy seems off-balance. The numerous hits to my moral compass aside the real reason I decided to write this review is that in spite of all my complaints (see above), I really liked this story. The author spent essentially three quarters of the story creating a cast of complete trainwrecks who all wanted to see each other rot in hell. If you create a mess you have to deal with it. And against all odds, the author Dealt with it. They reconciled the unreconcilable. They rescued the dead and the abandoned. And they did so with remarkable efficiency, optimism, and style. The revelations that lie at the end of this long, winding path hit me like a gorilla-sized brick in the face and entirely compensated for the pain of watching one particular red-haired clown clown his way through half of the serialization. There were some stellar moments of character development and, that’s right, Communication, and in some ways I think it was being made to suffer through hundreds of chapters of contrived misunderstandings and bad-faith arguments that made clarity so sweet. One line in particular, which I think taken out of context shouldn’t spoil that much, made me sit back in my chair and stare blankly out the window for ten minutes. “I have nothing to give”. Said while sitting on the living room floor, eyes dark, hands empty. General thoughts! A lot of romance-oriented manga/manhwa/etc has ‘stiff’ artwork and characters that only smile like L’oreal models. Cheese in the Trap’s art style is to die for. If there’s one thing I will vouch for from start to finish, it’s that. Oh, and Seol, whose character development and general attitude towards life is still incredibly inspiring despite the broader social narrative that was lacking. I also acknowledge that alongside the cast of clowns, there are also some gems, some clowns who become gems, and some characters that you’ll want to sit down and drink coffee and cry/fight/commit arson with. It’s surprisingly pessimistic, but it’s also surprisingly optimistic. So ultimately, is it worth it? I binged the entire thing in four days and don’t feel like I’ve lost too much time I’d want to bargain with god to get back. To summarize, personally: pros: artwork, characters, authentic slowburn romance cons: malice-fueled conflict that might make you tear your hair out, characters, weirdly simplistic and also nuanced worldview, an inconsistent moral compass Cheese in the Trap is, if nothing else, honest. It says what it wants to say. Is it necessarily true? Are your ears bleeding? Yes. But damn if you don’t want to stay for just one more minute, and see where the tides of Accounting and Business Marketing take our cast of four next. 7/10"}, {"score": "8", "content": "I'll be doing a short review of all Cheese in the trap, season 1 to 4. Story ----- 7 What I really enjoy about the story is its pace, there's often foreshadowing and flashbacks. Without them, the story would have no pace. The story itself isn't so good, but not that bad, slice of life mangas don't often have especially good stories. The drama is really, but really good here, it's not some clingy shoujo drama, here it's real shit, but it doesn't seem unreal too, and the reaction seem human-like (not like in other mahwas and manhuas where people don't behave like humans). Art ---- 9 Yes I love ... the art, it's not too precise and often only describe characters and not the environment. That makes a lot for character design and I really LOVE how people dress in this manhwa, that's a big + for me. Character -----8 It seemed to me at the start that the characters seemed too complex, but I was wrong. It's proven on the magnificent last chapter, maybe the creepy boy is just a lost guy in love ? The interaction between the characters are really human and relatable so I really enjoy it. Enjoyment -------8 Yes I enjoyed reading this awesome web comic, and so should you ! Overall ---- 8 That's probably one of the best of its genre out there, so be sure to read it. It's available free on Line Webtoon, so you have no excuses !"}]}

And now it's getting an anime adaptation. Story (9): This manhwa is the literal representation of balance. It's romantic yet not too cheesy, has drama but not too much dramatic. The balance is absolutely perfect. It's really well written and has many twists. You can rarely predict something and be right about that while reading this manhwa. The purpose of this story was probably to make readers see that we are the main characters of our life no matter where we are or how we are. And the writer ... really delivered it perfectly. Characters (10): Every single one of the characters in this manhwa deserves a 10. Starting from the knight to the king of the country, every single one of them are hilarious and wholesome. Also it has the best mc. The fl is strong, independent and despite facing life threatening events, she never lost her courage. The ml is strong and supportive and would literally destroy the world for the fl type of character. The chemistry that both these mc have with other characters are also noteworthy. And the way they interact with each other is also very hilarious. You really need to read the manhwa in order to understand what I'm talking about. Art (10): Has one of the best artstyle. I literally have screenshots of almost every characters xD. The drawer successfully managed to portray almost every emotions in the characters. Also it was really detailed. Overall (10): It really is the best one out there and I can guarantee that you won't regret it. So why not give it a try?"}, {"score": "9", "content": "I've read about a baker's dozen isekai manga/mahnwa, and this is by far the best one. It has drama and romance without being over the top. The plot has intrigue, mystery, and is compelling without being too contrived. Everything is well thought out and the story is well constructed. All of the characters are interesting in their own way, every single one. The twists are well-timed and while you can predict the occasional plot turn, most are welcomed surprises. The only thing that keeps this from being a 10/10 is some pacing issues. There are certain parts that overstay their welcome and I feel like ... the climax and ending of the story are a tad rushed. It's not something that overly detracts from the beauty of this story, but it's something that keeps it from reaching the level of masterpiece for me. It's a high quality story and I highly recommend it."}, {"score": "5", "content": "it's been a long time since i last read it so my memory may be innacurate. PLOT: the story starts off with raeliana wanting to do something about her ill-fated life as an expendable character in the novel she read. at first glance, it isn't much different from other transmigration manhwas. as the story progresses, it gives clues about the truth behind her transmigration, arguably the main conflict of the story. literally everything that happened to her life as raeliana was because of a certain action of someone who didn't want to remain as a nobody in a novel (it's confusing since i can't really provide ... too much spoilers). The most memorable is the fact the reason why Noah suddenly liked Raeliana. gotta admit, i liked their dynamic when they were still pretending to be a couple but when noah fell in love, i got turned off. i can't really find any credible reason why he would like her cause i don't consider 'because you're different' valid. to me, it felt forced and that was hard for me to read during the story. i'd rather not go with the specifics. the story is pretty decent with a few holes here and there, with the biggest one being the romance. the characters are decent as well. not too complex but not too bland either. def one of the better manhwas out there"}, {"score": "5", "content": "A story of romance and mystery in an isekai with subpar writing. I wanted to write a huge review, but life is too short to waste on this Manhwa. So, i will keep this simple. The pacing is very inconsistent. It starts out great, but after the first arc, it just stops progressing plot and adds a lot of filler content until we get to the final arc. You can easily cut half the chapters and still not lose any actual content. I read a lot of isekai trash, so i can honestly deal with boring story or whatever. But the worst part is plot conveniences. ... The number of plot conveniences makes it clear that the author had no idea what he was doing. 1. You setup a mystery and now we need to catch the culprit somehow. What do we do? We just introduce a convenient \"long forgotten\" magic spell which shows you the owner of the handwriting and immediately catch the culprit. Eventually, introducing \"dark\" magicians and even gods to solve mysteries. 2. FMC sees a villain going towards the baby's (prince) room and suddenly remembers that in the book, he's going to kill the baby. like wtf?? If you already knew this was going to happen, why not warn others? You already leaked knowledge of different future events to both MC and his brother (the king himself), why not tell them about the baby's death. The romance is also pretty boring. If you take away the fact that our FMC knows future of this book/world, then she has no unique traits. There were some sparks when they first meet, as he is trying to figure out how FMC knows his secrets, but eventually he falls in love because plot demands so. The main reason to have an average score is the decent Art and really hot characters like Vivian. I have a thing for red hair-ed women. There are other issues, but i cannot explain them without spoiling the story. With that said, If you like cringe romances, you will have fun. There are plenty of sweet and funny moments between MC/FMC. Just make sure to have low expectations."}, {"score": "7", "content": "First thing, this is, in my opinion, one of the best romance isekai manwhas around. The MC get's reincarnated as Raeliana, a character of a romance novel she read in the past. This character died soon in the novel, so she has to find a way to survive. This is nothing too original, but it is very well developed in this work. If I give it a 7 is because I consider the word used to describe a 7 (Good) as appropiate for this work comparing it with other works. Still, it's very difficult to find a \"princess romance manwha\" as well thought as this one. ... This was actually my first romance manwha, and opened the genre to me. It is worth the read if you like complex but cheesy stories. Now into it. Story: 7 (Good) Most of it revolves around romance and political maneouvring. As the MC doesn't have special powers or insane skills (Like in the Lady of the Lamp, for example), the author dedicates a good part of the story to the plots of the MCs and the villains and does a good job at it. Fans of palatial intrigue will like this story. The \"fake marriage\" of the Main Characters and how it evolves from fake to real is funny and sweet, and once true romance is established it doesn't lose the interest; it keeps evolving as the story progresses. The first part comprehends the efforts that Raeliana has to make to survive, and the establishment of the romantic relationship. By the point this review was written (Chapter 132) we seem to be entering the actual main plot of the story, the relation between the MC and the villain and why and how she was isekai'd. The story is well thought, and most recurrent villains don't act straight stupid like in other manwhas. People concerned with the writing will find it appealing. Art: 8 (Very Good) The art is well done and detailed, specially the dresses. It doesn't go godlike (Like in \"Your summon\") but it's pretty and pleasing to see, and extremely appropiate to the late 18th or 19th century feel the story conveys. It also improved as the series continued. There's not much to criticise. Good stuff. Character: 7 (Good) To be honest, most characters are straight up likable or hateful, and most of the main ones are pretty well constructed. The MC is smart and strong, although for some time she was too fixated with the \"original story\" before she was Isekai'd and it can get a little bit frustrating at some points. As a MC Raeliana is a very good character tho, better than most. The Male Lead, the Duke, is a smart as well, stoic, strict but just, kind in private, and (obviously) he ends up liking Raeliana. He is an atractive and competent Male Lead, cut a bit above the ones in many other romances. There are memorable secondary characters and villains around, as well. Enjoyment: 7 (Good) I read all of the available chapters in one go, some 6 or 7 months ago. The mysteries and conspiracies keep you hooked, as well as the desire for things to go well for both MCs and seeing the romance flourish. Things don't always go well for the MCs and the villains are competent, so the suspense becomes real. Overall: 7 (Good) High quality webtoon and, as I said before, one of the best balanced palatial romance stories around. Enjoyable if you like romance and intrigue. As recommendations, other good romance isekais would be \"The Lady of the Lamp\", \"Survive as the Hero's Wife\", \"This is an obvious fraudulent marriage\" and \"Iris, The Lady with a Smartphone\"."}, {"score": "9", "content": "My rating- 8.5 The story revolves around the concept of reincarnation and how to make the best of every situation thrown at you, of course in a just manner. Raeliana is the male female lead who is the person through whom we view the whole adventure, and it was a great idea for the author to do so. Although there are many reason for it, one of the main ones which struck out was the idea of gaining one's own individuality and independence. She is shown as a relatively younger (15/16 yrs old) girl who gets sent back in time by a miracle, after experiencing ... her own death by the hands of her fiancé. In this \"new\" life of hers, she decides to dedicate every minute for making herself comfortable and liable. It is refreshing to see a reincarnation manga written to not showcase how she meets a \"better\" man, but to show the FL (female lead) enjoying her second chance at life and learning life itself. The story itself has a great plotline, along with results which aren't fully (or even a bit) predictable by the reader, throughout the manga. It also, impressively, balances the amount of \"big reveals\" and manages to keep the suspense (or be interactive/funny enough for the reader to want to read more). Characters in this manga are also made to not only cater towards the readers, but to be understandable. So, even thought there is a \"bad\" person in the piece, there are moments where they are shown to have reasons to support them or show the reason behind the evil (trauma, mental issues, etc.). The art style used in the manga is also admirable. The intense emotions are perfectly portrayed to the readers, making them feel included in the ML or FL's decisions/traumas/situations. There are also chibi formats used, here and there, which include the smaller comedic relieves needed in a \"life/death\" manga such as this one. So, 9.5/10 would recommend, even if you're new to fantasy/Isekai/Shoujo world! Have fun reading!"}, {"score": "8", "content": "I've been binging a bunch of isekai romance manhwa's recently and this was one of the best I've read in the genre. While we all know what isekai's are about, what I liked about this story is the mystery aspect about it. It's not just \"why was I sent to this world?\" but also \"Who's trying to murder me and why?\" It has vibes from the isekai reverse harems that send the main character into a dating game as the villainess, but the protag here isn't a villainess. My favorite part about the story is the characters and some of minor twists that the story takes along ... the way. In Doctor Elise, characters play out exactly as you expect and the main protag's personality plays very much to the good girl image. Raeliana and the Duke, however, are like the opposite to that. They're sassy and sarcastic and flawed and quirky. They're combative towards one another and very much are an enemies to lovers sort of pairing. They have fun personalities and feel just very human, which makes their interactions with one another and the world entertaining to watch. Some of their interactions actually made me laugh out loud (which is very rare for me when reading a manga/manhwa). The manhwa isn't perfect. There are moments in the story that I felt were rushed. For some of the climax moments, I wish they had drawn out the moment more with more panels because it felt like we were zooming by pivotal and much anticipated moments. I wish we got to see more of the physical moments between Raeliana and the Duke, not just because spiciness is appreciated, but because at one point it felt like we jumped from no touchy to essentially married couple. With that said, it was still a very entertaining read that I would highly recommend it to someone else looking for a completed manhwa in this genre."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Before I get into the details, I just want to say that even though this story is not finished, I always tend to reread it just because of how enjoyable it is to do so. Story (9): For a story based around the usual, MC dying and waking up in a novel, it really knows how to grab your attention. Each character that either plays a small role or major role, each have importance to the story. One aspect of this story that I really like is how I can't guess or easily predict what will happen, because as of right now, I have been absolutely ... blown away with how the story is playing out. I would have never guessed any of what has happened, and that is a good feature that this story has. Art (9): Honestly, can I just say that most Manhwa's have really good art style? You can see every detail, the buildings are just god tier, and well, it's in color, something you don't see Japanese Manga in these days. As for this Manhwa though, the characters are drawn to catch your eye. Character (10): Finally we get a good MC who doesn't let people step all over them. Raeliana (The MC of course) is probably one of my most favorite Manhwa characters of all time. She's strong willed, she is hilarious with her interactions with the Duke and many others, and well, to put it frankly, she is a BADASS!!! I would love to explain why but that would be spoiling a bit, so you definitely need to read it for yourself! Enjoyment (10): I really enjoy how this Manhwa is playing out. The character development is depicted very nicely and does not feel rushed, and I never fail to laugh, even while rereading. The facial expressions the author does for these characters are just relatable. Overall (10): To finish up everything, you should definitely give this Manhwa a shot, I guarantee it will not be a waste of your time! Also if you're a fan of romance and all that jazz, it's a nice get away from the typical highschool romance."}, {"score": "9", "content": "From the anime to reading the full chapters of the manwha, all I can say is wow. After reading the manwha, I thought the storyline was unexpected. It is different for the normal \"I got reincarnated, now I need to survive with the knowledge I have from reading the book of this world\" - although it does start the story in this way. Let's see, I would recommend this to those looking to read something with an unexpected plot twist in the story. I personally like the banter between the male and female lead. It is always amusing to read. In this genre, there is always ... a strong female lead but, the difference from the typical protagonist, is that knowledge is not her only weapon in this world. The female lead actually uses a weapon to defend herself and isn't afraid to do so!! I know, what a shocker. The romance in this is kind of fun, and straight to the point once the confession happens and something else, which doesn't take too long. My personal take... watch the anime first, then continue to the manwha. It is really good and I highly recommend if you enjoyed the anime as much as I did."}, {"score": "9", "content": "The Reason Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke’s Mansion is everything you could want from a historical romance isekai, with a bold heroine, an irresistible slow burn romance, and just the right dose of political intrigue. Adapted from the original web novel and beautifully illustrated, this manhwa stands out in a crowded genre by flipping familiar tropes on their head. The story begins with Park Eunha, a modern day college student who mysteriously dies and wakes up in the body of Raeliana McMillan, a minor noblewoman fated to be poisoned to kickstart the original novel’s plot. But this Raeliana has no intention of becoming a ... throwaway character. Using her knowledge of the story and a lot of clever manipulation, she strikes a deal with the aloof and powerful Duke Noah Wynknight to pose as his fiancée and escape her doomed fate. Raeliana is one of the most refreshing leads in the genre. She’s witty, strategic, and doesn’t just rely on the usual damsel in distress tactics. Her inner monologues are hilarious, and her banter with Noah is pure gold. Speaking of Noah, he’s mysterious, calculating, and teasing in all the right ways. Their chemistry simmers from the start, and watching their dynamic evolve from fake engagement to something much deeper is one of the story’s greatest joys. The manhwa also doesn’t skimp on world building. The political maneuvering, noble family tensions, and magical elements are all well crafted and layered, giving the story weight beyond just the romance. The pacing is strong, the twists are satisfying, and the supporting cast, especially characters like Beatrice, Justin, and the scheming nobles, add complexity without stealing focus. Visually, the artwork is stunning. From the lush backgrounds to the characters’ expressive faces and intricate clothing designs, every panel is a treat to look at. It’s elegant, detailed, and absolutely binge worthy. If you love intelligent female leads, fake dating tropes with delicious tension, and a romance that builds with purpose and payoff, The Reason Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke’s Mansion is a must read. It’s sharp, swoony, and has enough bite to keep you hooked chapter after chapter."}, {"score": "8", "content": "You know.. It really surprised me how good the romance was..

It's a really nice drama that has some really surprising revelations, that you can see foreshadowed by small details in the story.

Noah her fiancee is cheeky, super.. SUPER overprotective and insanely hot too >.< gotta love dominant male characters, the difference is Raeliana holds ... her ground and doesn't always swept get by her feet... the confidence and bravery she must have.. Overall all the characters are well written with a large amount of humor in them <3 Art: 9.5/10 it includes color so brings it to life the art is detailed and well drawn, its beautiful. Story: 8.5/10 Story is simple but it keeps you hooked simply due to the characters, the relationship between rae and noah, it has the right amount of dramatic and doesn't over do it, to the point your head swirls. Although I pretty much figured the whole plot a few chapters in, in some parts the story seemed slow and in others it went really fast, example their wedding went fast there was no party etc, same with the child it doesn't how much of the pregnancy, and the spicy scenes ;) you could barely tell if they did it or not its vague D: . There are still some parts in the story that to me is still left unknown and kinda doesn't make sense, but its fiction right. Overall this manga teaches you something, it teaches you about love and how to deal with anxiety: focus on the present and not what you might have to worry about in the future, as a person who struggles with this, it kinda opened my eyes, to just live life. Everyone has their own story, their own main character or role, as much as you might wish or wondered what it would be like to be someone else, you have one life and it is up to you to choose what path you will take. I hope you enjoyed reading this :)"}, {"score": "6", "content": "First off, it needs to be clarified that this manhwa is not 27 chapters. I'm not sure why MAL shows it that way, but there are in fact 158 chapters with the final 11 counting as 'extras'. What ultimately drew me to this was the anime adaptation which only covers the story up to around chapter 50. What happens after, was a very plodding story that introduces several new people, places, and figures without really utilizing them in any gratifying narrative payoff. The story starts with a modern teenage girl trying to get into college. Her future derails however after she dies and is reincarnated as ... an extra in a popular romance novel from her past life who is fated to die. Using her knowledge of the story, she makes a deal with the main love interest in order to avoid her fate. Without going into spoilers, the story just seems to go where it wants without concern for advancing the narrative. It can't decide on whether it wants to be a rom com with occasional drama, or slice of life. I want to be fair here. The best way I can describe my dissatisfaction is that the story makes a lot of \"tight turns\" very clumsily. Too many events just \"happen\" without proper buildup or any future payoff. Up until chapter 50, I was on board with this story. The art is nice and the chibi art for the comedy segments may occasionally illicit a chuckle. However, the most interesting/enjoyable characters like Raeliana's adorable little sister, her stylist Nick Maddox, and Ansley (one of the only female guards) barely get any screen time over the course of the story. I read this over 3 days and I'm struggling to remember anything significant happening between chapter 50 and 90 when the story finally starts to feel like it's moving forward. I wanted to put it down so many times, but that average MAL score (at the time of this writing) 8.19 was too significant to ignore. Again, without spoiling the end, the main reason why the MC reincarnated into this world ends up being pretty silly in hindsight. It doesn't even tie up all loose ends like the fate of certain characters. If I knew how the story would unfold, I would never have read it in the first place. I have to believe that the novel does a better job of covering world lore and fleshing out characters than this. Otherwise it just feels like needless padding. For anyone seeking a better story along similar lines, I would highly recommend \"The First Night With the Duke\". It's shorter, still charming, not amazing, but it's the same story just told better."}]}

Romance 101 was a wonderful story both in terms of handling difficult topics, but also in terms of character-writing. I loved that every single character was so different. Especially the main characters that seem to really develop throughout the ... story.

Initially I wanted to score this a 9 but after some careful thinking, I will score it a 10. This webtoon is truly one of the most realistic slice-of-life / romance stories I've read, ever and that says quite a lot since I've been reading that genre for the past 10 years. It truly highlights the struggle of balancing your university life with your personal life and finding your true love. This story is a hidden gem. Characters: ... There are quite a lot of characters but they all stand out in their own way, with either their personalities or backstories (or both). I find the FL very interesting and cute, she is so well written in my opinion. She isn't annoying in any way but truly a likeable and relatable character. Same goes for the ML. They have a great and healthy dynamic with an open communication. Which leads to a story more focused on the plot rather than having angst and miss-communication between the FL and ML as a key point. The supporting characters are also very well made and they balance out the story which gives it more depth. I also love how the FL evolves through the story. Story / Art : A good slife-of-life story, many of the characters have relatable problems (first and foremost in romance, but also in other subjects). The pacing is good and there isn't rushed moments. The comedy in this story is so good too. Some panels are so funny I had to screenshot them and save them, either because they are SUPER relatable or just so funny that I will end up using them for a meme. As for the art, this isn't the typical art style I go for but it grew on me and I got quite fond of it. Don't let the art style stop you from reading something as good as this! I recommend this story to anyone, no matter if this is your first, second or your 100th time reading a romance / slife-of-life story. I will say it again, It is a HIDDEN GEM amongst the romance genre. I hope this webtoon will get more attention soon.

And honestly got me surprised to have one of the characters had the same problem with their love life as me. Art: At first, I thought the art was strange, but I grew fond of it. ... The expressions are very detailed and some bits are quite funny, and I really like how the comedy comes from the art and the expressions of the characters. Characters: I absolutely love the characters. The girl MC didn't come off as annoying, but instead came off as someone relatable, with mistakes and problems that she has to solve in the story. The two love interests are also interesting, although I'm leaning towards the gap moe gamer boy who loves to keep his precious image in public. And I absolutely love how the best friend character isn't a blank slate who just follows the main character around, but instead, she's also has her own problems that the story also gives a healthy amount of screentime too.

This was a refreshing read that left me feeling light, happy, and understood. As we follow the story, we witness the relationship between the male and female leads develop and blossom. There’s no excessive drama, no foolish actions—just pure sympathy and care. It’s giving a bit of an enemies-to-lovers trope, but not in a simplistic, black-and-white way. Our protagonists simply needed time to understand their feelings. One of the aspects I loved most about *Romance 101* is how it uses various characters’ stories to present multiple ... perspectives on dating, friendship, breakups, and other relatable experiences. As you turn the pages, you realize it’s okay to take time for yourself after a big breakup, it’s okay to have some drinks with your friends and feel angry, and it’s okay to feel down or happy—communication is key. While of course not all characters can form their emotions into words (as we saw in the chapter where while people might think that the mental state of the person is shallow, the well of it is still as deep as the ocean). In Romance 101, we encounter a diverse cast of characters, each with different backgrounds and approaches to life. The narrative doesn’t pass judgment, reminding us that being different doesn’t equate to being wrong or bad. Deep thoughts aside, Romance 101 offers a bit of an emotional rollercoaster (thankfully not forced), cheesy love scenes, genuine friendships, and a dash of everyday worries. It's a 100% recommend!"}]}

There was an appropriate level of detail for a story that is focused more on the characters than ... the surroundings or action. For stories like this, it is the intensity and variety of expressions shown by the characters, and the ability of the artist to show what is happening between the characters with pictures rather than having to rely on words, that I use as a meter of how well drawn the manga/manhwa is. In this case, the artist does an excellent job of portraying visually expressive characters. The story is clearly very well thought out. The whole manhwa is peppered with events and interactions between the characters that seem insignificant or out of the blue at time, but that are later explained and shown to be all interconnected. I have come across a lot of anime/manga where mysterious events are not explained until later on, but in such a way that the reader is left frustrated and confused in the meantime, or in a way that makes it obvious that the writer was struggling to tie up loose ends and plot holes. In contrast, it is very clear in this manhwa that any details that aren't immediately revealed to the reader have been left out for a specific reason, and the writer already knows in advance what those details will be. These details are mainly revealed by flashbacks (if you dislike a story that relies heavily on flashbacks, then I do NOT recommend that you read this manhwa), and after seeing these flashbacks, there is always a moment of \"OH! So that is what/why such and such happened\". It is also worth mentioning that the flashbacks are very clear to follow - I never struggled with recognizing when the story was showing the present time vs a flashback, and it was also easy to determine how far into the past the flashback was supposed to represent. As well-executed as the story was, it is the characters that really shine in this manhwa. There are a couple of different reasons why I found the characters to be so exceptional: -They are flawed. Both the antagonists and the protagonists have serious, realistic personality flaws, and because of this, they have more realistic interactions and struggles in their lives. -They show significant character growth over time. As a result of the regular process of maturing, interactions with other characters, and specific events in their lives. Seol in particular is a fantastic example of character growth as she morphs from a weak-willed pushover who just wants to please the people around her to an independent woman who does not hesitate to stand up for herself. There are some instances where it is questionable as to whether or not the character growth is positive or negative (for example, there are some things that Seon does that are somewhat cruel or manipulative), but I find that to make her a more interesting character as she searches for the right balance in her personality. -Family ties are an important and on-going part of who the main characters are. I come across a lot of manga (especially manga in the school/romance genre) where at least one of the characters have parents who are completely out of the picture, for one reason or another. To be honest, I find this to be a lazy writing style. Yes, it allows the story to focus more on the character's romantic relationship, but having the family present in the character's life allows for a more dynamic interaction, and also give another impetus for character growth. Seol, Jung, and Inho all have part of their family as an active part of their lives, and in all of their cases, their family interactions are a very important part of the direction that the story goes in. -I am a sucker for a strong, dynamic, well-written female character, and Seol definitely becomes that over the course of this manhwa. Watching her grown into such a strong character was very enjoyable."}, {"score": "9", "content": "I was going to flip because I can't find any Cheese in the trap (CITT) in top manga section lol. because of no review, I will try to write one but this is a review for entire CITT.

Sounds good, right? Wrong! First of all, roughly 98% of the content is centered around martial arts. I mean, fictional martial arts. Things like \"Sword Force of the Heavenly Demon,\" \"Supreme Sword Sky of the Heavenly Sword,\" \"24 Heavenly Demon Swords,\" \"Sword Art of the Demon God.\" One of these is made up by me, but all of them are completely identical from a ... narrative standpoint (and butchered by translation). Of course, they require a different number of years of training or cultivation or whatever. But seriously, the sole motivation of the characters is to unlock the N+1 technique of the chosen hard-to-spell martial style. And they do. They train hard. They gain insights into unimaginably godly powers so they can train more and gain more insights. Oh, how awesomely powerful they are! But... why? Is there anything else in this world besides constant training and martial growth? Well, yes. Revenge. And that's it. There is no life where these awesome powers could be applied. The world consists only of martial clans who either fight with the main character or submit to him. The MC doesn't even have friends; he has only subordinates. His life is spent training, fighting, studying, negotiating, and teaching his underlings. Well, I wouldn't have judged if it were real life, but it's supposed to be entertaining for us, isn't it? And the \"original\" sci-fi aspect? Well, it's not real sci-fi; it's \"technobabble.\" It shows when the author clumsily tries to marry it with acupuncture-based medicine, qi channels, ghosts, etc. Frankly, instead of \"nano machine,\" they should've used something more standard and relevant, like an inner demon or something. And it fades into the background once the MC becomes sufficiently powerful on his own. Now, there are things that are genuinely good: art, violence, overwhelming power, the concept of the nano tech in the xianxia setting (early on). But they are not sufficient to compensate for the absence of anything besides the bland and repetitive martial progression and one-sided elimination of \"enemies\" for the sake of revenge."}, {"score": "10", "content": "One of the best murim manhwa I've had the pleasure of reading alongside Return of the Blossoming Blade and The Legend of the Northern Blade.

You follow every move precisely. I would say that it is a work that goes beyond what it sets out to do; being a story about revenge ... and ascension, the script knew how to be patient, stop and rest when needed; taking advantage of the nuances. The protagonist is not thrown into the plot, his only characteristic being overpower, he is, first of all, emotionally intelligent, it is worth mentioning; not only learns, but visibly grows from its own mistakes, and the way the script cleverly surrounds it, exposes itself to is own immaturity, takes you by surprise. When everything seems set for him to lose control, he is angry, but not a fool. What's the use of having a second chance and becoming strong but... being an idiot?

He and his 6 brothers who are full blood nobles are in competition for the throne, but due to the mixed blood status Yeo-woon faces great difficulties.

Sometimes the story is quite nice to follow, but there are many times where practically nothing is happening, or the way the story is told is way too chaotic for my tastes. It's mostly basic fights between the antagonists and main character, but with real story elements sprinkled here and there. I have some difficulties following the dozens of sect names & events, so story isn't the easiest to follow, but this might be because I read it with translator changing nonstop. Characters (6 / 10): There is real character development to be seen for everyone, but it's not done in a way that feels significant. It's also hindered by the fact that there are far too many characters in the manhwa to properly explore. Everyone is mostly sidelined, but after maybe chapter ~120 some side characters have received more time in the spotlight. Art (7 / 10): The art is good, but character designs are sometimes far too samey and I get lost in understanding who is who.

I initially found this murim manhwa somewhat enjoyable, despite it is still \"generic\", compared to other murims in the first chapters . While the characters lack depth, the power system feels shallow with badass name but unexplored skills, and the MC gains random power-ups with no foreshadowing, the story at least had a coherent plot during the earlier chapters. But I could tolerate these issues and kept reading until the academy arc ended Unfortunately, everything fell apart even further after that arc. Not only the plot became messy, the power creep escalates to absurd levels, with the MC gaining even more random power-ups. Within ... less than 50 chapters after the academy arc, he becomes either the strongest or the second strongest in the entire verse. From this point on, the plot becomes unbearably repetitive: random fodder from some sect or organization underestimates the MC, only for him to effortlessly destroy them. To make matters worse, the story has introduced some of the most baffling and downright frustrating plot points. (MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!) For instance, the MC has non-consensual sex with a woman under the pretext of \"saving her life,\" which is both disturbing and nonsensical. Another example involves him killing an ally's relative simply because she was \"annoying.\" LIKE WTH ? I understand the author’s attempt to create a morally grey and realistic protagonist, diverging from those typical kind-hearted, heroic murim MC archetype. However, the execution is terrible. The MC’s ideology is unclear, his motives are questionable, and many of his actions are just outright stupid. For example, why kill that relative because she is annoying, especially when doing so creates unnecessary risks? Worse still, his personality is wildly inconsistent—he forgives an assassin who tried to kill him early in the story and even becomes friends with them later, yet he casually murders someone connected to his ally over a trivial annoyance. The story’s decline in both plot and character consistency makes it hard to continue reading.

This series has a somewhat interesting premise, lemme give you a little synopsis: there is this cult, demonic cult, and this little fella is the illegitimate son of the cults leader. there is some other factions that wnat him dead so they send some assasins. just as he was about to die someone from future and iinjects him some nanomachines, kills the assasins. and there is this academy that he has to go and beat other leader candidates up to rise to throne. so sounds intriguing at first, right? Nope, total power fantasy. Characters have ... no proper personality other than \"i love the mc\" or \"i hate the mc\"..These fellows are either way too loyal to this guy or way to hostile. But there is some common ground: bewilderment. I swear to god half the manhua is people talking to themself about how strong this guy is. every fight progresses the same: bad guy attacks somebody from mc's side or mc, they 95/100 times underestimate them then get surprised when they got beaten. thats it, thats the manhua for you. I promise you, you wont get anything else other than this. They dont explore the nanomachines, its just used as a tool to make mc overpowered and solve situations that are redeemed impossible to solve, and i swear the only reason is to shock people nothing else. If something is happening, it's happening for the reactions. So what about the mc? is he as paper thin as the rest of the crew? Well... i frankly dont know. One thing i can tell is that 9 out of 10 times he solves the issue with violence. Like, even when there was no need for it. And it aint no targeted violence. Straight up massacre. And many times the casualties are enemies of the enemies. like they arent even hostile to him, he just killing them to... kill? hide his identity? idk maybe last few chapters left an weighed more than it should, but i cant remember a time he didnt kill them, aaah of course not the woman and chilren tho. he is the good guy after all(!). I personally dont have a problem with killing or massacres, even think that it is somewhat lacking in other manga/hwa/hua's. There is situations where it has to be done, and when done correctly could be a great scene. But here it is just another tuesday. every single fight ends in people needlessly dying, mostly cuz they werent on mc's side. Character development you said? does mc change over the course of the manhua? no. he doesnt. his prior motivation to rise to top is his mothers dead, and to find the person who orchestrated it. he doesnt change a bit during this, not a single bit. there is no moral dilemma, zero! Nobody questions him when he is killing, and the ones that do are usually doing so internally, mostly while dying. There is also no stakes. He wins, end of story. I understand that this is supposed to be a power fantasy but this is too much. Fight scenes already suck (visually speaking) and the so called martial arts are total bullshit, nothing more than some dance moves at best. On top of this you know from get go that he is gonna win, so what is the point? btw this futureboy that injects him nanomachines? never explored. He doesnt even think about him. not once. not kidding, he doesnt give a shit. Spoilers ahead! before coming to conclusion i want to give a little inkling of an idea on how needlessly cruel he is. So there is this woman, divine physician. rumored to be able to fix anything. they meet her yada yada she asks mc to save her granddaughter from some bandits, says she would swore allegiance if he did so. Now they go around asking and find these bandits. they kill em and turns out this woman is married to one of these bandit, vice-captain or smth. she even has a baby with him. she is openly on the side oof bandits, even going as far a stabbing one of the member of mc's crew. so they of course kill everyone but the baby nd the girl. she is outraged, wearing at them and threaten to tell her grandma(divine doctor or smth) to not join them. Mc's asks nanomachines to analyze her and finds out that she has symptoms of stockholm syndrom. This is, to me, a very interesting dilemma; probably the only one so far(150 cahpters in btw). Now it would have been better to intruduce this before the fight, so that the conseqeuent actions would have bigger meaning, but i was alright with this too. But instead of diving deeper to this dilemma and exploring it, he just kills her. Just like that, no second thought given. At that point in the story he is the leader of the cult so he has to make state level decisions, and i know that these decisions can be hard. But it has to be portrayed as so, otherwise it comes of as a cold blooded killer killing people, just because he doesnt know how to deal with situations that require more than 3 brain cells. But every one of these aspects are tolerable. you dont really start to think \"oh he is gonna win anyway\" until like 50-60th chapter, and i wasnt having problems with it until 150~ chapters, solely cause i didnt care enough to mull on. But the one thing that makes it intolerable to me is the goddamn comment section. it is god awful. not a single critical thought is formed in that place. I would much rather pick the fucking bear, rather than any man from that comment section. They are vile, dimwitted, have penises for brains and couldnt form a coherent sentence to save their lifes. Am i doing something wrong with my life? is what i am thinking when i see myself consuming the same media as these degenerates.

The patterns that let it down (these are my observations up to chapter 229, not the novel) are: | {The text below does not envolve tell story main points but still it exposes patterns so I recomment first read the Manhwa a bit then read this review} -The MC never gets hurt, and even if he does, it doesn’t count, resulting ... in knowing the outcome before any fight. -The MC’s friends never get killed, not a single one; even if they do, they come back to life. -The MC kills all or nearly all of his opponents/observers, even when he doesn't need to. This again makes it very predictable. Simply put, I want the MC to face real risks where he either loses his allies or faces his own death. While reading this, I always know that every fight is without risk, so what’s the point? I’d also prefer if the MC were a bit more unpredictable when making decisions about life and death, not always choosing to kill. Lastly, if you enjoy political drama, then definitely read this! Highly recommended. It also has good fights, even though they’re one-sided. wanted to rate it 6.7 overall rating because of drama"}, {"score": "4", "content": "Boring. The story suffers from a lack of stakes, shallow character development, and a predictable story. There are no challenges, meaningful relationships, or any type of side content, this manhwa offers little beyond repetitive power fantasy tropes. The MC consistently wins every conflict without any real sense of struggle or stakes. Each new enemy is hyped up as incredibly strong and dangerous, yet the MC defeats them effortlessly every time. Since the beginning of the story, there has not been a single time the MC has lost. Each new technique he gets is hidden in absurdly elaborate ways, as if designed exclusively for the MC to find them. ... Thanks to his overpowered \"nano-machines,\" has no problems getting them, removing any sense of accomplishment. Also, he sometimes goes as far as destroying the sources of these techniques, as if someone else could learn about them. The problem is that no one else ever seems remotely capable of uncovering or mastering them anyway. This makes the world feel devoid of competition or tension. There's never really any challenge for the MC. Any problem can be conveniently solved by the nano-machines, and when he encounters a new enemy he's conveniently always at just the right power level for him to defeat them. Sure, they can show him struggling a little but it's clear after the first few times that he's never in any danger. When an enemy makes a plan to defeat him, the MC somehow anticipates and counters it flawlessly, with absolutely no foreshadowing. Instead, the just show a flashback of secret preparations, expecting you to accept that he predicted everything perfectly. Relationships within the story are shallow and underdeveloped. While the MC has followers and even has the loyalty of high-ranking elders, there is little sense that he has genuinely earned this loyalty. The story skips over interactions that might show meaningful connections, conflicts, or character growth. He just shows up, beats someone and suddenly everyone trusts him and devotes their life to him. All of his followers with him are spineless and soul-less characters that don't have any kind of personal motives. They never challenge him or disagree, making them feel spineless and devoid of individuality. Their entire personality is being loyal to the MC. The MC himself is a flat character. He gets angry a few times at the start but after some days in isolation confinement he magically matures and never shows any flaws again. The only time he feels positive emotions is when he gets a new technique and (only sometimes) gains a new follower. As for the negative emotions he only shows hatred toward those responsible for his mother’s death. It's a classic OP MC power fantasy story, and it's not a problem by itself but it's not executed well. Since the MC has no hardships everything he does is boring. Normally this is balanced by interesting side characters and/or comedy but it has neither of those. The side characters receiving minimal development, they are never shown training or living their life and barely shown interacting with each other. Almost every conversation they have is about the MC. There are no side plots, just him and his revenge which goes as smoothly as it can get. The thing that finally made me drop this is when he finally defeats his father. With the help of only a small group, the MC dismantles his father’s elaborate plans with no credible explanation of how he could have known every move in advance. Then, a hidden organization appears, revealed to have been operating in the shadows all along. However, this group had virtually no buildup in the prior 130 chapters, save for a vague hint about the use of the demonic reversal technique. Their sudden introduction feels random and forced, resulting in a chaotic climax where the MC predictably triumphs without significant effort. The only refreshing thing is that he has no problems killing/maiming or torturing others."}, {"score": "5", "content": "The manhwa is really good at the start.

The MC was killed at first, but his 200xgreat grandson comes back from the future and install him some nano machine. This apparently able to heal the MC’s decapitated head, added some broken abilities to it also. He used that power to revenge everyone that wronged him, and in the later chapter, he is now just a killing maniac who just kill and ... kill with any bit of annoyance he found, even if the enemy gave up, even if they were innocent. He just brute force his way through everything. This is when the story goes downhill. There is no more adversaries. Even his companions are now poorly developed because it only focuses on the MC flexing his all mighty power everywhere he goes. The author build up the plot just to tear it down instantly as the MC just one shot everyone now. Using power that he didn’t break a sweat learning or earned it through hardwork. Everything was handed to him on a silver platter, a Gary Stu type of story. It gotten bland, boring, and can’t take it seriously anymore.

Although there are many stories out there that have a similar theme, I think this one has its own uniqueness and beauty. I'm not a big fan of webtoons/manwha, because I've been growing up reading too much manga. Up until at this point, when I read western comics I still get confused reading from left to right. But I have to say, webtoons are more convenient to read since you just scroll down (ignoring the occasional left to right reading). Even though I find it inconvenient reading this sort of thing; it's a sacrifice I have to make, because the ... story is just so darn good. One of my biggest pet peeve when it comes to manga (call me shallow),is the art. I just can't stand reading manga with bad art (or messy art). If I was to criticize this webtoon, I would pick the art. Throughout the story, the characters are drawn in chibi form most of the time, which was annoying for me at first. But then I realized, during crucial events in the story--the art would change. At that point I understood what the Manwhaga was trying to do. I looked beyond the art, because it served a role in influencing the meaning of the story. The main theme in this story is finding happiness in the relationship each human being has with one another. I praise this webtoon for sharing such strong human emotions--it brought me to tears. This is where the art comes in; in simple moments where the characters are happy, the manwhaga draws them in chibi form; it conveys the message of how in our everyday lives we can find simple and little things to make us happy. But moments in the story where it involves amazing emotions, the art changes into a more serious version. I thought that was true for all mangas/manwhas/webtoons, but in the case of this webtoon it was special. Seriously, this is a beautiful story. It talks about how everyone how human relationships are important; and the beauty of how we all can depend on each other. Although the drawing lacks detail, the story fills in the gaps. simple, beautiful"}, {"score": "5", "content": "I don't know maybe I'm all alone in this big world, who doesn't like this manwha. I don't recommend it for those who search deepness and originality of characters in story.This authors manwha- it's too facile. I hate story's with fake fantasy characters who hasn't tasted the real rough of life- how you really do get abandoned. Believe me, I do talk out of personal experience.This author made the human life tragedies look like they from Mexican melodrama evening. With their unbearable sweetness, goodness and sentences like: \" master I'll be waiting for you forever!!!\"-cry cry cry, or :\" don't fight son, be a good ... person, nooo don't die like your father did!!!!!no!! I die for you, protecting you in the street so you can just be a better person when I'm gone!!\" Eugh. This much banality in one place I haven't seen in a long while. Just ruins the originality of the plot. The painfulness and human life agony should be expressed subtly, delicately like in Midorikawa Yuki or Maeda Jun stories... So I didn't enjoy it. At first I really liked the plot, but later on it just gotten more and more ridiculous. And the art is ugly, especially the tears- like spume from the eyes. Fans don't get mad- it's just my opinion. It was short review, but I wish I will find people who look deeper, than: \" oh it's a story about people with infirmity living hard, finding each other, living strong and doing an interesting melodramatic story out of real life roughness, keep us entertained!yeah!\""}, {"score": "10", "content": "I often wondered how a deaf and blind person would communicate and when reading this touching story about these two people I learned that for some love is not about looks, the way they speak, what they do, or anything other than the complex yet simple feelings of love that these two people have for one another. This story is a masterpiece and is to me an instant favorite and I would highly recommend that you drop everything and read this manga this very instant don't argue just do it trust me you wont regret it for this is a what I call a true ... masterpiece not because of the art but because of the touching story of these otherworldly like people who love each other despite all odds where anyone else would falter this is truly a masterpiece.

I can handle series that are heavy-handed with misery so long as there is a pay-off at the end. But this... it was a very frustrating read. The premise itself is fine, but the majority of the main couple's issues stem from outside people who just want to stir shit up. The main character is frequently dealt a bad hand in life to the point where whenever one good thing happens to him, like five more bad things happen as a result. Almost every character has their own tragedy laid out in complete detail at seemingly random areas. The fucking DOG got several ... chapters of tragic backstory. Overall, I had to frequently stop reading and take breaks because it just got to be too stressful to read. It honestly felt like misery p/rn. Understandable hardships in this series get diluted by a side character sharing their over-the-top tragic backstory, and it really feels like an exercise of how bleak they could write a story. Like I said, I can handle a heavy-handed story for the most part, and while there IS a silver lining, they really do drag you in the dirt until the last chapter and it just... didn't feel satisfying at all. Like I put myself through reading this for THAT? That really is my biggest beef with the series. I think the art is fine but the story is drenched in often unrealistic drama that seeps into characters you can't tell if you're meant to like or not. If you want a feels trip, read something else."}, {"score": "2", "content": "Thus review contains spoilers ahead. When I was reading this manhwa I could hear Oprah's voice in my head like, \"You get a sad back story, you get a sad back story, eeeeeverybody gets a sad back story\" and it wasn't far from the truth. Story: This author takes melodrama to a whole new level. I understand the need for creating a tragedy to sympathise with your characters, but you know you're overdoing it when even their PET gets a three chapter background where it cries and experiences more emotions than a pregnant woman. There are two pets in the story and ... both of them had the harshest life imaginable. Here's the thing, using tragedy as a plot device has its limits. Use it too little and the readers won't feel the impact, use it too much and it becomes laughable. We become desensitised to it. Having two people with disabilities live together is a very interesting concept in itself, it doesn't need cheap drama to strengthen its theme, which, at its core is two people overcoming their hardship to achieve happiness. But no, the author adds crazy jealous woman in love with the hero, a crazy jealous man in love with the heroine, attempted rape, suicide, an inexplicable illness that is suddenly flung on us, dragged out and cured just as quickly --anything even remotely dramatic you can think of, it's all there. It makes me indifferent to the characters. They could get hit by a bus in the next page and I couldn't care less. Characters: Even if I put the melodrama aside, the love between the two main characters didn't feel real. It was this codependent mess of a relationship where she basically becomes his 'sight'. I wouldn't mind it if it was only in the beginning, but no this guy doesn't learn to cope by himself. He uses her as a crutch at all times and never learns to be independent. That's just not right. Overall: It feels like the author didn't know how to end the manhwa and took the tragic death route, but suddenly changed his mind in the last chapter and wrapped everything up with a time skip and a (dubious) happy ending on top. So there. Two points for the potential this manhwa had to be something good, but was ever able to meet it."}, {"score": "10", "content": "To say I cried my eyes out while reading this manhwa is an understatement. From chapter 1 I was glued to this. The story was INCREDIBLY deep and hit home big time! Some characters were rather annoying...BUT HEY! You need an annoying character or two somewhere along the line! Before reaching the halfway mark of this manhwa I felt as if...I myself...as a person needed to change, to be someone like Sori...To be grateful for everything I have and take NOTHING for granted(Which is incredibly hard to do...as we always take things for granted). Make sure to keep plenty of tissues in close proximity. It's ... only natural to sob your heart out with this manhwa(webtoon) and have the urge to start feeling more grateful towards the simple things in life. This IS my favorite manga/manhwa to this day. You're missing out if you don't bother with this manhwa or drop it halfway through(Why would you even?!?!) The feels train is going to be overcrowded by the time everyone has finished this."}, {"score": "5", "content": "This was honestly a disappointing story, which I felt had a lot of potential in the beginning. The best part of the story is the couple in focus and their relationship, they're somewhat tragic people who found each other and really rely on each other as reasons to live. Their relationship is strengthened and the story has it's most touching moment in my opinion when a secret one of them has is exposed, and I really enjoyed most of what happened up to this point. But there are unfortunately other characters in this story, who are written so childishly I could hardly believe they weren't used for ... comic relief but actually had an important impact on the story. One or two side-character are decently written, and especially one is a genuinely nice guy, but the others serve no purpose other than to create horribly childish drama. I think I was 11 years old when I had the emotional maturity of these people. The main character also has moments of complete mental inhibition though, especially towards the end, which I can only attribute to the author wanting to create artificial drama and sadness. The story would be well served if it focused on actual realistic problems a couple like this might face, but instead this could have been any other people facing the same dilemma. The conclusion made me feel nothing, which is almost impressive from a story that made me tear up in places it didn't try half as hard. I was in disbelief at how stupid and artificially melodramatic everything was towards and after the end. The art is decent, far from the best I've seen but also far from the worst. It gets a plus for originality since I recognized it from another series the author made."}, {"score": "10", "content": "Have you ever wondered how a blind guy can communicate with a deaf person? Can't See Can't Hear but Love shows how communication is possible through love. It's a really great story that tells us what a blind man can see and what a deaf person can hear. The story is great. The characters are depicted beautifully. While reading it, I can feel strong emotions within me. Happiness, anger, sadness that I even cried (I don't really cry a lot so having stories that makes me cry really strikes my heart). The art is not what we are usually looking for for a manga(well this ... is a manwha and a webtoon so I think its really good). Nevertheless, it was used beautifully in this work. Overall, I'd say it's a masterpiece! By the way this is my first review so I don't really know what to write :D"}, {"score": "10", "content": "So this is the first manga, or rather manhwa, that I've completed from start to finish. And I have to say, what a way to start my journey into such an art form. Can't See Can't Hear But Love is one of the greatest pieces of literature that I've ever read. The story is quite simple. It is about a deaf woman, a blind guy, and their life together. The manhwa explores both of their current dilemmas, as well as their future and past as well. Certain events come up that create difficult choices for each character. While there are some comedic moments throughout the ... manhwa, this is mainly a drama. In my opinion, Can't See Can't Hear But Love contains some of the most touching scenes I've seen in a piece of art since Clannad: After Story. And yeah, that's high praise. There were more than a few scenes that were absolutely heartbreaking to read. One of the reasons I never bothered reading or finishing any type of manga is because I never thought that something like that would get an emotional response from me. Obviously, I've received such from other pieces of art, such as anime, books, and movies, but I just didn't think a comic book, manga, or manhwa, could complete with those art forms. But man, I was wrong. I cried so many times reading certain parts of this manhwa that I couldn't possibly say the exact number. It's absolutely beautiful. Because this is a manhwa, every piece of artwork is in color. I thought this was quite nice, although not necessary. The images became more more alive due to the colorful palette. There were times were color was used in a very intelligent as, like showing a flashback or hinting at a dark moment. I was quite impressed by this and feel that the story was heightened due to such a add-on. Can't See Can't Hear But Love is rich with some of the most heartwarming characters ever. Geun Soo, the blind guy, is a very flawed character. He has issues with family, lies sometimes, and can be difficult to deal with in certain circumstances. But this is more than okay because it shows that he is human. Geun Soo isn't perfect. He's a good human being who doesn't fully understand himself, but wants what's best for everyone around him. Sure, because he is blind, he struggles more than most people everyday. But he also struggles with his emotions. The manhwa explores these difficulties in great length throughout the manhwa. So Ri, the deaf girl, is one of the strongest female characters I've ever encountered. I couldn't help but feel how much she cared for Geun Soo during the story. So Ri sacrifices a lot in order to help Geun Soo during certain events that come up. She fights because of her will to live, be happy, and make sure that Geun Soo enjoys his life as much as possible. She is often treated poorly, not just because of her vision, but due to her being a woman as well. Despite the hardships she faces, So Ri never gives up. Supporting characters in Can't See Can't Hear But Love also play a vital role when it comes to the main characters and their wants and desires. These supporting characters are all fleshed out nicely. You learn about every single one of their upbringings and why they are the way they are. It's clear that every single person in Can't See Can't Hear But Love have been through a lot, which is why they aren't perfect and can sometimes be disgusting in the way they act towards others. Overall, I can't recommend Can't See Can't Hear But Love enough. This is one of the most touching stories I've ever read and gives a real life view of the world from the perspective of two people who are unable to live normal lives due to their disabilities. Even if you hate reading, don't care for manga, or feel that a dramatic story like this one is a waste of time, I would implore you so please read it. You won't regret it. This is not just a masterpiece in storytelling. No... it is also one of the most important pieces of art that will be remembered for years to come. Can't See Can't Hear But Love is a must read and receives my highest recommendation."}, {"score": "5", "content": "As an artist myself, this was a bit difficult in the beginning. Him suddenly getting blind because of his work, made me quite anxious, not gonna lie. Being blind surely is scary for everyone, but even harder for people, whose work requires them to see. Authors can still easily write after becoming blind, but artists? Drawing without eyes is a bit difficult. Anyways. The beginning was good. I don't really like reading hetero stories, so I didn't go in with many expectations, but actually got surprised for the better. Sori's and Min's relationship was really healthy and I could truly feel their love for each other. ... They were happy and actually couple goals. But then the whole jealousy plot started and it really just got exhausting to read. It started around chapter 10 and stretched throughout chapter 82, with only there being a character development. It wasn't even them. Usually romance stories have love-triangles, that involves the MCs directly, because either one of them can't let their ex go or whatever, right? This was worse, even. The MCs were just pawns here, pushed around by everyone. Trying to hold on to their love for each other, but their disabilities getting in the way and making it easier for the antagonists to intervene. It really was just the antagonists working together to get what they want, without the MCs even knowing what's going on. Just pushed around like babies, naive and unable to do anything. But not quite. Sori was just that throughout the whole story, but Min kept becoming more of a jerk too. He lied so much to her. It was so unfair. She kept working hard to earn money, even going for a modeling career because it would give him enough money for an eye surgery; and what does he do? Lie. Lie about his condition, that he's gonna die soon. Kept pretending everything's fine, while she was the one worrying. He lied about his mother at first too, they overcame that step, and he promised to never lie to her again. ... He managed about 2 weeks before lying again. It's just sad. I feel so bad for Sori. I genuinely don't know how I managed to keep reading. I'm so tired and energy-deprived. I'm not even sad, even though this was supposed to be a drama and emotional. I really didn't care anymore for the characters by the end. I just wanted it to end. And when it finally did, I felt nothing. Empty shell. Just glad it's over. Only sad part being is that I hoped for a good story. There aren't many comics about deaf or blind characters, especially not two disabled MCs. So, of course you'd hope for it to be good, right? Sadly it's not. Unless you're a huge fan of extreme drama and jealous characters, who'd do everything to get what they want, even if it'll hurt the person they \"love\", this might be your next favorite. But unfortunately I'm not a drama-loving person. It's fine to some extent, but this was too much. If the book was only from chapter 0 to around 30, I'd probably give it 5 stars. As said, I really liked it at the beginning. I teared up lots of times. Some of the early chapters are quite emotional and reflective. Sadly only gets downhill and the focus shifts to the jealous side characters, who will do anything to force the people they \"love\" to be with them. Worst part is they didn't even get lectured for it. Sure, they didn't get to be with them in the end, but one of them should actually sit in jail. But does he? No. He's free as ever and even has a family. So disgusting. ~ I've heard a lot of criticism about the art, but I have to disagree on that. It might not be very clean and aesthetically pleasant, and there are much better works which are much older than this, but it works for the story. Even with that much drama, it is still a slice of life story. It's not bad. It might be bad for every other story, and might seem a bit lazy too, but that's life isn't it? I've seen lots of people especially criticize the crying. That it's ugly. Well, surprise, crying in real life is ugly too. If you want Disney-crying, go watch a disney movie or read a fantasy story. But this is a slice of life and drama story about hardships. You think you look pretty when you have a breakdown and cry your soul out? Probably not. In my opinion, it would've been worse and taken away the realistic part, if the author gave them princess-faces during the crying panels. Yes, some of the expressions look ugly, but that's what makes it good. Another point I liked, but many disliked for some reason: the comedy. While it was a lot and sometimes a bit unnecessary maybe, it was a part I'm glad the author kept. With all the extreme drama going on, the comedy brought the story down to earth again, reminding you that it's slice of life. And with all the eye-rolls I've done, the funny bits made me smile again. Forgot all the tension for a moment and could enjoy at least one or two panels, before it went annoying again. I also didn't mind the POVs and backstories from the other characters, and even the pets. It was random, true, but in a good way. You don't normally get this much screen-time for background characters like this, so it was interesting getting to know them more. Nice world-building and reminds you once more that everyone goes through hardships, all the time, even though they are not the MC. Sounds obvious but, admit it, we do keep forgetting that sometimes. ~ As with every book, there were good and bad parts. For this, the bad parts weigh down more than the good ones, sadly. Do I recommend it? Not really. If you only want to read it because of the blind and deaf representation, go ahead. That part is more or less well-made. And the way they communicate is wholesome. But if you actually want to enjoy the 84 chapters and are hoping for a good story, then don't. Unless, as said, you're a drama-fan, this is rather tiresome to digest. The ending isn't even worth all that and was very predictable anyways. Fairy-tale like. ~ Is there strong character development? Chapter 0-81? No. They only got worse. Chapter 82-83? Yes. Suddenly a 180 degree change. Did you find the characters loveable? I liked 2 characters; Sori and Yeom. Dong also a bit, but his crush on that one girl is a huge toxic trait. Otherwise every character is just annoying or an asshole or both. Would you say the cast of characters is diverse? Apart from the deaf and blind character (and the grandpa who wears leggings and heels (he's slaying those looks btw)), no. Everyone else is stereotypically k-drama. Very extreme and alike. Are the flaws of the main character(s) a main focus of the book? Yes. Their flaws are their main personality. It's not just \"flaws\", it really is incredibly toxic. Most know of their \"flaws\" but don't even bother to change."}, {"score": "10", "content": "THIS MANWHA IS A FEEL TRIP AND IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY. IF YOU HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANY TYPE OF SAD ROMANCE MANWHA, YOUR LIFE WILL BE HELLA SAD AFTER READING THIS...but you will feel completely and utterly satisfied and fulfilled. In simplest terms, this is a story about a blind man and a deaf woman. These two disabled individuals find solace and hope in each other, and eventually fall in love. Throughout their time being with each other, hardships are frequent and conflicts arise with other people. This is due to them not having faith in themselves, despite having faith in each other, and also ... because of other people not believing in such a relationship. Even so, like the title says, they may not be able to see and hear, but the only thing they can do is love. This is what makes the manwha beautiful, as the manwha is exactly what the title is. It never lies to you and it also gives you an excellent image of a situation that may appear to be difficult and is difficult, but something that is not impossible to achieve. For those who have never read Korean manwha, art style differs greatly from Japanese manga. In my personal opinion, Korean manwha is more simplistic in terms of drawing and has more involvement with color. The way things are draw are more about the least strokes of the line, the image depicted with the strokes, and the manipulation of colors that bring the story to life. The way the artist uses color is indeed very important and how they do it can affect how something looks. With Nasty Cat, or Yeong-Hun Go, the author of Can't See, Can't Hear, But Love and also his well-known Trace series, color is all around, but there are merely sections of color. While CSCHBL has beautiful environments, Nasty Cat focuses his colors mostly on characters, which are what he wants you to focus on. As this is a manwha that is depicting the lives and relationship between two disabled individuals, how they see the world is different. In order to understand them, one must focus on how they live with their disabilities and other people versus how they interact with the world. For Geun Soo, he is blind, so most of his world white or a bit dark. For So Ri, who is deaf, she can still see the world just like any other person, so environments are full colored. She also is the positive influence and light of his life, so this is why her colors are very warm and his are very cool. The artistic choices in this manwha are not only very smart, but very intuitive in terms of how the characters feel and what they are going through. With the characters, everyone has a backstory that is quite sad, except for the president. The characters are expanded upon and they interact quite nicely. The character development is strong with this one. Each character has their own flaws, but since this a romance manga about a blind person and a deaf person, the problems that characters have to overcome or solve are 1) their physical or mental disabilities, 2) their emotions, and 3) their will to continue on. The reason why I say #3 is because the ability to persevere and the likelihood of giving up comes wiith any situation, whether it is having a disability, being uncertain about love, or not being able to do what you enjoy. I believe Nasty Cat wrote this story and drew these characters in hopes that the audience is able to understand their hardships, how to overcome them and accept them, and to show that you can also learn to love like this, learn to persevere in the darkest of times, and that nothing is impossible. Relationships can be difficult, but life is already difficult, so you don't have to do it alone and maybe your connections with other people can help you believe in yourself again. Love and having faith are very strong symbols in this story, especially in this type of circumstance that Nasty Cat reveals to us. Believing in yourself, in your own ambitions, and in others can help achieve many things. You may not be able to see a new start, to hear the end of sad times, but love and belief in that love can bear fruit to many other good things. This was a good ride and a hell of a feel trip. I highly recommend this manwha and also Nasty Cat's other work.

As expected in this type of genre there will be many characters with unfortunate circumstances or tragic histories and the loss of love or loved ones is a constant theme. That being said, just because this manhwa uses many cliches and tropes from the genre, doesn't mean that it's boring. It's actually quite well done, decent written (although some translations are rough) and over all very engaging. This story pays more attention to the disabilities of the main characters than some similar works do, so it's interesting to see how the ... main couple struggles to communicate, but it also serves as a metaphor for the difficulties people have in general of being honest, or honestly communicating with each other. You can see this theme repeated in several interpersonal relationships throughout the entire story. While this work is a drama, there are definitely several comedic bits here and there and the interactions between some of the characters are down right funny. This helps break up some of the seriously depressing scenes and keeps the overall tone from being too dark. That being said, this story is absolutely a melodrama and it builds to a nice and satisfying conclusion. The only real criticism I have is that the uneven quality of the art work. Some of this is obviously stylistic choice, as you can tell in the differences between how some of the main characters, particularly Jeon Sori, are portrayed. However even without that, there is an overall lack of detail and roughness to the art work that creeps in from time to time.

This is one of the most beautiful manga I have ever read. I finished it up in two days. It has a way of appealing to your feels and get you hooked up in the story right away. I will start by saying, this manga changed the way I see life and the difficulties I face and the way I deal with them. It is a train full with feels and tears that made me really happy and thankful of life. Story: The story is as you can expect from the title, about a ... guy who can´t see and a girl who can´t hear. However it has a very good development and it gets the feels out of you. It´s has some flashbacks during the present time in order to explain how everything got to be. It is a very beautiful story, which won´t let you stop reading even if you want to take a brake or sleep. It moved me to tears in countless times and it showed me a new world in manga. Art: The art is good, lets leave it at that. Despite the image picture you get at MAL the real drawing are not even compared to that. Even though its a Korean manwha and they tend to draw more real humans. I think this time it wasn´t as good as others manwhas. But anyways its still good and some of the expression they draw are pretty hilarious. I´m not being to rough on the art because the reason I read this was for the story more than the drawings. Character: Well what can I say, this author has the trait or habit to develop even the pets stories. It has a great and well timed character development, because some things aren´t as clear until they start with the flashback explaining how everything went. The way of describing the characters really gets you. And also because you start getting attached to them, and that´s when the feels started to get me. Enjoyment: Easily one of my favorite manwhas. I enjoyed it non stop from beginning to end. The jokes, the sadness and even the way people trying to get in between their love. It´s really a MASTERPIECE and it will move you and make you cry for real. Reading it non stop will get you dehydrated for sure. Overall: A must read and you won´t stop reading it.

Rather than having a flow and let the things start growing, we are dealing with lovey-dovey moments that readers might actually shed a tear, and boy... I wanted to bang my head to wall for this 6 chapters that I've read. Other parts ain't worth mentioning because they are below minimum. It's really baffling how this one has such a high-rate. TBH, I actually think author has written this manhwa in one go, because he's afraid to look back and see how awfully and forcefully written his work is. Another half-ass review, guys & girls. ta-ta."}, {"score": "10", "content": "A very deep story. Even though the main character are both disability person, they still can live together. They communicating in unique way and understand their partner's feeling. Spend times together and help each other with daily activities. The heroin never give up and always support the hero to facing obstacles. Their love is so strong. I really love this manga. It has its own sentimental feelings."}]}
